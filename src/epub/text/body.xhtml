<h2><i>DON'T GET TECHNATAL</i></h2>

<h3>by ron reynolds</h3>


<p>For several moments Stern had eyed his typewriter ominously,
contemplating whether he should utter the unutterable. Finally:</p>

<p>"Damn!" he roared. "I can't write any more! Look, look at that!" He tore
the sheet out of the rollers and crumpled it in his fist. "If I'd known
it would be this way," he said, "I wouldn't have voted for it!
Technocracy is ruining everything!"</p>

<p>Bella Stern, preoccupied with her knitting, glanced up in horror. "What
a temper," she exclaimed. "Can't you keep your voice down?" She fussed
with her work. "There now," she cried, "you made me drop a stitch!"</p>

<p>"I want to be a writer!" Samuel Stern lamented, turning with grim eyes
to his wife. "And the Technate has spoiled my fun."</p>

<p>"The way you talk, Samuel," said his wife, "I actually believe you want
to go back to that barbarism prevalent in the DARK THIRTIES!"</p>

<p>"It sounds like one damned good idea!" he said. "At least I'd have
something decent, or indecent, to write about!"</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> you mean?" she asked, tilting her head back and thinking.
"Why can't you write? There are just oodles of things I can think of
that are readable."</p>

<p>Something like a tear rolled down Samuel's cheek. "No more gangsters, no
more bank robberies, no more holdups, no more good, old-fashioned
burglaries, no more vice gangs!" His voice grew lachrymose as he
proceeded down an infinite line of 'no mores'. "No more sadness," he
almost sobbed. "Everybody's happy, contented. No more strife and hard
work. Oh, for the days when a gangland massacre was headline scoop for
me!"</p>

<p>"Tush!" sniffed Bella. "Have you been drinking again, Samuel?"</p>

<p>He hiccoughed gently.</p>

<p>"I thought so," she said.</p>

<p>"I had to do something," he declared. "I'm going nuts for want of a
plot."</p>

<p>Bella Stern laid her knitting aside and walked to the balcony, looked
meditatively down into the yawning canyon of the New York street fifty
stories below. She turned back to Sam with a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>"Why not write a love story?"</p>

<p>"<i>WHAT!</i>" Stern shot out of his chair like a hooked eel.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she concluded. "A nice love story would be very enjoyable."</p>

<p>"LOVE!" Stern's voice was thick with sarcasm. "Why, we don't even have
decent love these days. A man can't marry a woman for her money, and
vice-versa. Everyone under Technocracy gets the same amount of credit.
No more Reno, no more alimony, no more breach of promise, or law suits!
Everything is cut and dried. The days of society weddings and coming out
parties are gone&mdash;cause everyone is equal. I can't write political
criticisms about graft in the government, about slums and terrible
living conditions, about poor starving mothers and their babies.
Everything is okay&mdash;okay&mdash;okay&mdash;" his voice sobbed off into silence.</p>

<p>"Which should make you very happy," countered his wife.</p>

<p>"Which makes me very sick," growled Samuel Stern. "Look, Bell, all my
life I wanted to be a writer. Okay. I'm writing for the pulp magazines
for a coupla years. Right? Okay. Then I'm writing sea stories,
gangsters, political views, first class-bump-offs. I'm happy.... I'm in
my element. Then&mdash;bingo!&mdash;in comes Technocracy, makes everyone
happy&mdash;bump! out goes me! I just can't stand writing the stuff the
people read today. Everything is science and education." He ruffled his
thick black hair with his fingers and glared.</p>

<p>"You should be joyful that the population is at work doing what they
want to do," Bella beamed.</p>

<p>Sam continued muttering to himself. "They took all the sex magazines off
the market first thing, all of the gangster, murder and detective
publications. They been educating the children and making model citizens
out of them."</p>

<p>"Which is as it should be," finished Bella.</p>

<p>"Do you realize," he blazed, whipping his finger at her, "that for two
years there hasn't been more than a dozen murders in the city? Not one
suicide or gang war&mdash;or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" sighed Bella. "Don't be prehistoric, Sam. There hasn't been
anything really criminal for twenty years now. This is 1975 you know."
She came over and patted him gently on the shoulder. "Why don't you
write something science-fictional?"</p>

<p>"I don't like science," he spat.</p>

<p>"Then your only alternative is love," she declared firmly.</p>

<p>He formed the despicable word with his lips, then: "No, I want something
new and different." He got up and strode to the window. In the penthouse
below he saw half a dozen robots moving about speedily, working. His
face lit up suddenly, like that of a tiger spying his prey. "Jumping
Jigwheels!" he cried. "Why didn't I think of it before! Robots! I'll
write a love story about two robots."</p>

<p>Bella squelched him. "Be sensible," she said.</p>

<p>"It might happen some day," he argued. "Just think. Love oiled, welded,
built of metal, wired for sound!" He laughed triumphantly, but it was a
low laugh, a strange little sound. Bella expected him to beat his chest
next. "Robots fall in love at first sight," he announced, "and blow an
audio tube!"</p>

<p>Bella smiled tolerantly. "You're such a child, Sam, I sometimes wonder
why I married you."</p>

<p>Stern sank down, burning slowly, a crimson flush rising in his face.
Only half a dozen murders in two years, he thought. No more politics, no
more to write about. He had to have a story, just had to have one. He'd
go crazy if something didn't happen soon. His brain was clicking
furiously. A calliope of thought was tooting in his subconscious. He had
to have a story. He turned and looked at his wife, Bella, who stood
watching the air traffic go by the window, bending over the sill,
looking down into the street fifty floors below....</p>

<p>... and then he reached slowly and quietly for his atomic gun.</p>

<p>AN EXPLANATION: You may have wondered why I placed the Technocrat story
and article in FuFa. Well, it's because I think Technocracy combines all
of the hopes and dreams of science-fiction. We've been dreaming about it
for years&mdash;now, in a short time it may become reality. It surely
deserves support from any serious fictioneer. And you can't say this mag
isn't balanced!&mdash;first I give you Yorke's article on Tech., then I give
you a satire on the same thing, jabbing at it in a good-humoured way,
and then&mdash;when you read Ackerman's article, you'll see almost the
complete annihilation of EARTH. So, whether you are an optimist or a
pessimist about the future of humanity, you'll find either side in FuFa.
(But on the side, I'm all for the Technate, aegh!)</p>

<p>THE RECORD was written first in 1929, scarcely more than a sketch,
on two pages. Ackerman was thirteen. ED EARL REPP, LA author of THE
RADIUM POOL, said of it: "I found it delighting and exceptionally
interesting for the writing of a boy so young." Ackerman re-wrote
it into a three page story, later, the present product. It has not
been touched since. It is not being retouched now. Allow me to
present THE RECORD as a <i>record</i> of how Forrie wrote, spelled and
punctuated six years ago at the age of sixteen. <i>ED.</i></p></blockquote>




<h2>THE RECORD</h2>

<h3>by FORREST J. ACKERMAN</h3>


<p>For twenty years&mdash;for twenty long, horror filled, war laden years the
Earth had not known peace.</p>

<p>Hovering over the metropolises of the world came long, lean battle
projectiles, glinting silver in the sunlight or coming like gaunt
mirages of grey out of the midnight sky to blast man's civilization from
its cultural foundations. Man against man, ship against ship&mdash;a
ceaseless and useless orgy of slaughter. Men, at their battle stations
in the ships, pressed buttons, releasing radio bombs that blistered
space and lifted whole cities up in shattered pieces and flung them
down, grim ruins, reminders of man's ignorant hatreds and suspicions.</p>

<p>And gas&mdash;thick black clouds of it&mdash;billowing over the cities, seeking
every possible egress, pushed forward by colossal Wind machines. But
even when Victory came for the one side, often Nature, in one of her
vengeful moments, would send the black gas flowing back to annihilate
its senders.</p>

<p>Rays cut the air! Power bombs exploded incessantly! Evaporays robbed the
Earth of its water&mdash;shot it up into the atmosphere and made of it a fog
that condensed only after many months. And heat rays made deserts out of
fertile terrain.</p>

<p>Rays that hypnotized caused even the strong minded to commit suicide or
reveal military secrets. Rays that effected the optical nerves swept
cities and left the population groping and blind, unable to find food.</p>

<p>It was a war that destroyed almost all of humanity. And why were they
fighting? <i>For pleasure and amusement!</i></p>

<p>In the middle of the twenty-second century, every nation had a standard
defense. The weapons of war of each were equal&mdash;not in proportion to
size, but actually, since man-power no longer counted high. Pacifism had
done its best, but the World was armed to the hilt. And now&mdash;though
illogically&mdash;it felt safe&mdash;for every nation meant the same as if all had
nothing.</p>

<p>Another thing&mdash;there was no work to be done. Robots did it. And there
seemed nothing left to discover, invent or enjoy. Art was at its
perfection, poetry was mathematically correct and unutterably
beautiful&mdash;worked out by the Esthetic machines. Sculptoring had been
given the effect complete, artists hands guided by wonderful pieces of
machinery. Huge museums were crammed with art put out synthetically.</p>

<p>And thus it was with the many Arts and their creators who grew stagnent
in their perfection. And it was that way with the many sciences
also....</p>

<p>Paleontologists had found, and articulated, and catalogued every fossil.
The ancestor of the Eohippus, the little four-toed Dawn Horse, was
discovered; the direct line between man and ape established in skeletal
remains; the seat of <i>life</i> itself definitely proved Holarctica. And
great bio-chemists, skilled in the science of vital processes, had
created synthetic tissues and muscles and flesh, built upon the frames
that had been recovered bodies with skillful modeling ... even supplied
them with blood and given them the spark of LIFE ... so that
Paleobotonists recreated the flora of a prehistoric era. Again the
ponderous amphibious brontosaur pushed through marshes. Fish emerged
upon the land, and the first bird archaeopteryx tried his imperfect
wings for flight. In the regulated climates of long dead ages, fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals lived again for the edification
of those interested in the very ancient&mdash;or who were amused with queer
animals.</p>

<p>But that was only paleontologically speaking. There were the heavens to
be considered. They had been: the stars and planets weighed and
measured, their composition noted, courses plotted with super-accuracy.
Every feature had been mapped&mdash;every climactic condition recorded. Life
had been named and numbered ... then photographed. And these were but
first considerations. Actually, what wasn't known about the Solar System
had not occurred as yet. But that would probably be remedied by a
machine to view the future.</p>

<p>There was physics, biology, anthropology, zoology, geology,
bacteriology, botany&mdash;and 'ologies' and 'otonies' and 'onomies' such as
ran into figures which only machines could calculate.</p>

<p>A book could indeed have been written of the accomplishments of super
race. But this is of the WAR itself, and how it came about, and how
it all ended.</p>

<p>Stated simply, in 2150 the point of DIMINISHING UTILITY had been
reached. To the hungry man, the first course of dinner is wonderfully
delicious, the second good, the third satisfying. Through the ages
people have hungered after luxury and leisure&mdash;but when he finds his
food, a lot of it, MAN finds suddenly that it no longer appeals to him.
In fact, too much is bound to make him sick and often disagreeable. He
looks around for something else. So did the people of the 22nd Century.
They had all of the pleasurable amusements they wanted, but it was all
so intellectual. Everything was culture. They had surfeited with it. And
suddenly they wanted to forget it. All play and no work made MAN a
discontented citizen. A reaction set in. Man was not completely
civilized as yet&mdash;&mdash;THE WAR!</p>

<p>Twenty-one years the war raged. And scarcely a million survived. Bit by
bit this million was whittled down by the weapons of destruction to
ragged handfuls of things that once had been cultured. Finally only one
hundred humans remained alive&mdash;and they kept fighting blindly, none of
them realizing how close to oblivion they were crowding themselves and
the future of humanity&mdash;and they went on killing, killing, killing!</p>

<p>It is doubtless but what the entire human race would have vanished,
leaving the world to the more competent, though half-ignorant, hands of
the beasts, who fought and killed one another for self-preservation and
for food&mdash;not because of madness ... and who did not have books and talk
and have <i>culture</i>. The human race would have gone, had it not been for
the record.</p>

<p>The fighters of WAR'S END, leaving their machines and countries to
congregate for personal combat, were engaging in hand-to-hand attacks in
the ruins of what once had been a tall and powerful city in the
Twentieth Century, but now lay crumbling, its proud buildings falling to
the ground, sticking out iron-rusted skeletons to the sky&mdash;and the city
was LOS ANGELES!</p>

<p>HEDRIK HUNSON was fighting with phosphorized fists&mdash;hand inclosed in
chemically treated gloves that burned as they struck the antagonist,
insulated on the interior for the wearer&mdash;when suddenly the two of them
were caught by a spreader. The other man died instantly, but Hedrik got
it in the side and was whirled about sickeningly, and survived.</p>

<p>He was lying painfully on something when he came to, but felt too dizzy
and sick to move. At last, when his head had cleared a bit, he rolled
over into a sitting position and reached out his arms to grasp&mdash;a
phonograph!</p>

<p>Big things came in small packages in the days of 2171, and a portable
phonograph might well be taken for a weapon of some sort&mdash;which was
exactly what Hedrik thought! And you can hardly blame him, because no
one in that generation had ever seen one of the things.</p>

<p>There was a curious story connected with the dying of music, concerning
the days of 2050 when there was a movement to stamp out all symphonies
and songs and things even slightly sentimental.</p>

<p>&mdash;but back to Hedrik!</p>

<p>Hedrik found the crank that wound the portable, turned it, reasoning
that perhaps it gave power&mdash;and then&mdash;holding it away from him&mdash;he
waited for rays to spurt out or something to explode. Nothing happened!
Hedrik was disappointed. After an agony of perspiration and puzzlement
he finally accidentally placed the needled arm onto the disk. The disk,
he noticed, was black and filled with little undulations. The disk was
like a wheel&mdash;so Hedrik thought&mdash;it should revolve like one, shouldn't
it? He pushed the starter thoughtfully and was more than surprised when
the disk started spinning.</p>

<p>From the phonograph came music&mdash;music and singing! The lost Art had
returned! The Art banished under compulsion had made a comeback.</p>

<p>Some man was singing on the record&mdash;in a queerly interesting and
familiar tongue, the ancient English. The singer seemed sad, almost
crying. And Hedrik was thrilled as he played it over and over again,
drinking in the new experience like wine on the lips of a connoisseur.
The voice rose, fell, lingered. And Hedrik suddenly didn't feel like
fighting anymore!</p>

<p>The music floated out over the tumbled ruins, descended to the ears of
the other people. AND THE FIGHTING CEASED! They were transformed. They
came running to crowd about the machine.</p>

<p>And there in that aged music shop they stood enthralled&mdash;music filled
their souls. It was exactly what they had needed and wanted for many
years. And it had been denied them. Music was the balancing force ...
the force that would help them struggle ahead rebuilding the world. And
next time they would be saner ... they knew ... the lesson of luxury had
been learned and learned well. Never again would they leave all of the
work to the machines. Now they would work and sing and play.</p>

<p>It would be work ... hard work ... for some time to come. But they had
found music again, and that would anchor them to sanity.</p>

<p>And thus was mankind saved through a record&mdash;<i>SONNY BOY!</i></p>

<h2>THE PENDULUM</h2>

<p>Up and down, back and forth, up and down. First the quick flite skyward,
gradually slowing, reaching the pinnacle of the curve, poising a moment,
then flashing earthward again, faster and faster at a nauseating speed,
reaching the bottom and hurtling aloft on the opposite side. Up and
down. Back and forth. Up and down.</p>

<p>How long it had continued this way Layeville didn't know. It might have
been millions of years he'd spent sitting here in the massive glass
pendulum watching the world tip one way and another, up and down,
dizzily before his eyes until they ached. Since first they had locked
him in the pendulum's round glass head and set if swinging it had never
stopped or changed. Continuous, monotonous movements over and above the
ground. So huge was this pendulum that it shadowed one hundred feet or
more with every majestic sweep of its gleaming shape, dangling from the
metal intestines of the shining machine overhead. It took three or four
seconds for it to traverse the one hundred feet one way, three or four
seconds to come back.</p>

<p>THE PRISONER OF TIME! That's what they called him now! Now,
fettered to the very machine he had planned and constructed. A
pri&mdash;son&mdash;er&mdash;of&mdash;time! A&mdash;pris&mdash;on&mdash;er&mdash;of&mdash;Time! With every swing of
the pendulum it echoed in his thoughts. For ever like this until he went
insane. He tried to focus his eyes on the arching hotness of the earth
as it swept past beneath him.</p>

<p>They had laughed at him a few days before. Or was it a week? A month? A
year? He didn't know. This ceaseless pitching had filled him with an
aching confusion. They had laughed at him when he said, some time before
all this, he could bridge time gaps and travel into futurity. He had
designed a huge machine to warp space, invited thirty of the worlds most
gifted scientists to help him finish his colossal attempt to scratch the
future wall of time.</p>

<p>The hour of the accident spun back to him now thru misted memory. The
display of the time machine to the public. The exact moment when he
stood on the platform with the thirty scientists and pulled the main
switch! The scientists, all of them, blasted into ashes from wild
electrical flames! Before the eyes of two million witnesses who had come
to the laboratory or were tuned in by television at home! He had slain
the world's greatest scientists!</p>

<p>He recalled the moment of shocked horror that followed. Something
radically wrong had happened to the machine. He, Layeville, the inventor
of the machine, had staggered backward, his clothes flaming and eating
up about him. No time for explanations. Then he had collapsed in the
blackness of pain and numbing defeat.</p>

<p>Swept to a hasty trial, Layeville faced jeering throngs calling out for
his death. "Destroy the Time Machine!" they cried. "And destroy this
MURDERER with it!"</p>

<p>Murderer! And he had tried to help humanity. This was his reward.</p>

<p>One man had leaped onto the tribunal platform at the trial, crying, "No!
Don't destroy the machine! I have a better plan! A revenge for
this&mdash;this man!" His finger pointed at Layeville where the inventor sat
unshaven and haggard, his eyes failure glazed. "We shall rebuild his
machine, take his precious metals, and put up a monument to his
slaughtering! We'll put him on exhibition for life within his
executioning device!" The crowd roared approval like thunder shaking the
tribunal hall.</p>

<p>Then, pushing hands, days in prison, months. Finally, led forth into the
hot sunshine, he was carried in a small rocket car to the center of the
city. The shock of what he saw brought him back to reality. THEY had
rebuilt his machine into a towering timepiece with a pendulum. He
stumbled forward, urged on by thrusting hands, listening to the roar of
thousands of voices damning him. Into the transparent pendulum head they
pushed him and clamped it tight with weldings.</p>

<p>Then they set the pendulum swinging and stood back. Slowly, very slowly,
it rocked back and forth, increasing in speed. Layeville had pounded
futilely at the glass, screaming. The faces became blurred, were only
tearing pink blobs before him.</p>

<p>On and on like this&mdash;for how long?</p>

<p>He hadn't minded it so much at first, that first nite. He couldn't
sleep, but it was not uncomfortable. The lites of the city were comets
with tails that pelted from rite to left like foaming fireworks. But as
the nite wore on he felt a gnawing in his stomach, that grew worse. He
got very sick and vomited. The next day he couldn't eat anything.</p>

<p>They never stopped the pendulum, not once. Instead of letting him eat
quietly, they slid the food down the stem of the pendulum in a special
tube, in little round parcels that plunked at his feet. The first time
he attempted eating he was unsuccessful, it wouldn't stay down. In
desperation he hammered against the cold glass with his fists until they
bled, crying hoarsely, but he heard nothing but his own weak,
fear-wracked words muffled in his ears.</p>

<p>After some time had elapsed he got so that he could eat, even sleep
while travelling back and forth this way. They allowed him small glass
loops on the floor and leather thongs with which he tied himself down at
nite and slept a soundless slumber without sliding.</p>

<p>People came to look at him. He accustomed his eyes to the swift flite
and followed their curiosity-etched faces, first close by in the middle,
then far away to the right, middle again, and to the left.</p>

<p>He saw the faces gaping, speaking soundless words, laughing and pointing
at the prisoner of time traveling forever nowhere. But after awhile the
town people vanished and it was only tourists who came and read the sign
that said: THIS IS THE PRISONER OF TIME&mdash;JOHN LAYEVILLE&mdash;WHO KILLED
THIRTY OF THE WORLDS FINEST SCIENTISTS! The school children, on the
electrical moving sidewalk stopped to stare in childish awe. THE
PRISONER OF TIME!</p>

<p>Often he thot of that title. God, but it was ironic, that he should
invent a time machine and have it converted into a clock, and that he,
in its pendulum, should mete out the years&mdash;traveling <i>with</i> Time.</p>

<p>He couldn't remember how long it had been. The days and nites ran
together in his memory. His unshaven checks had developed a short beard
and then ceased growing. How long a time? How long?</p>

<p>Once a day they sent down a tube after he ate and vacuumed up the cell,
disposing of any wastes. Once in a great while they sent him a book, but
that was all.</p>

<p>The robots took care of him now. Evidently the humans thot it a waste of
time to bother over their prisoner. The robots brot the food, cleaned
the pendulum cell, oiled the machinery, worked tirelessly from dawn
until the sun crimsoned westward. At this rate it could keep on for
centuries.</p>

<p>But one day as Layeville stared at the city and its people in the blur
of ascent and descent, he perceived a swarming darkness that extended in
the heavens. The city rocket ships that crossed the sky on pillars of
scarlet flame darted helplessly, frightenedly for shelter. The people
ran like water splashed on tiles, screaming soundlessly. Alien creatures
fluttered down, great gelatinous masses of black that sucked out the
life of all. They clustered thickly over everything, glistened
momentarily upon the pendulum and its body above, over the whirling
wheels and roaring bowels of the metal creature once a Time Machine. An
hour later they dwindled away over the horizon and never came back. The
city was dead.</p>

<p>Up and down, Layeville went on his journey to nowhere, in his prison, a
strange smile etched on his lips. In a week or more, he knew, he would
be the only man alive on earth.</p>

<p>Elation flamed within him. This was <i>his</i> victory! Where the other men
had planned the pendulum as a prison it had been an asylum against
annihilation now!</p>

<p>Day after day the robots still came, worked, unabated by the visitation
of the black horde. They came every week, brot food, tinkered, checked,
oiled, cleaned. Up and down, back and forth&mdash;THE PENDULUM!</p>

<p>... a thousand years must have passed before the sky again showed life
over the dead Earth. A silvery bullet of space dropped from the clouds,
steaming, and hovered over the dead city where now only a few solitary
robots performed their tasks. In the gathering dusk the lites of the
metropolis glimmered on. Other automatons appeared on the rampways like
spiders on twisting webs, scurrying about, checking, oiling, working in
their crisp mechanical manner.</p>

<p>And the creatures in the alien projectile found the time mechanism, the
pendulum swinging up and down, back and forth, up and down. The robots
still cared for it, oiled it, tinkering.</p>

<p>A thousand years this pendulum had swung. Made of glass the round disk
at the bottom was, but now when food was lowered by the robots through
the tube it lay untouched. Later, when the vacuum tube came down and
cleaned out the cell it took that very food with it.</p>

<p>Back and forth&mdash;up and down.</p>

<p>The visitors saw something inside the pendulum. Pressed closely to the
glass side of the cell was the face of a whitened skull&mdash;a skeleton
visage that stared out over the city with empty sockets and an
enigmatical smile wreathing its lipless teeth.</p>

<p>Back and forth&mdash;up and down.</p>

<p>The strangers from the void stopped the pendulum in its course, ceased
its swinging and cracked open the glass cell, exposing the skeleton to
view. And in the gleaming light of the stars the skull face continued
its weird grinning as if it knew that it had conquered something. Had
conquered time.</p>

<p>The Prisoner Of Time, Layeville, had indeed travelled along the
centuries.</p>

<p>And the journey was at an end.</p>

<h2>THE FIGHT OF THE GOOD SHIP CLARISSA</h2>

<h3>by one who should know better</h3>
<p>The space rocket Clarissa was nine days out from Venus. The members of
the crew were also out for nine days. They were hunters, fearless
expeditionists who bagged game in Venusian jungles. At the start of our
story they are busy bagging their pants, not to forget their eyes. A
sort of lull has fallen over the ship (Note: a lull is a time warp that
frequently attacks rockets and seduces its members into a siesta). It
was during this lull that Anthony Quelch sat sprawled at his typewriter
looking as baggy as a bag of unripe grapefruit. ANTHONY QUELCH, the
Cosmic Clamor Boy, with a face like turned linoleum on the third term,
busy writing a book: "Fascism is Communism with a shave" for which he
would receive 367 rubles, 10 pazinkas and incarceration in a cinema
showing Gone With The Wind.</p>

<p>The boys upstairs were throwing a party in the control room. They had
been throwing the same party so long the party looked like a worn out
first edition of a trapeze artist. There is doubt in our mind as to
whether they were trying to break the party up or just do the morning
mopping and break the lease simultaneously. Arms, legs and heads
littered the deck. The boys, it seems, threw a party at the drop of a
chin. Sort of a space cataclysm with rules and little regulation&mdash;kind
of an atomic convulsion in the front parlor. The neighbors never
complained. The neighbors were 450 million miles away. And the boys were
tighter than a catsup bottle at lunch-time. The last time the captain
had looked up the hatch and called to his kiddies in a gentle voice,
"HELL!" the kiddies had thrown snowballs at him. The captain had
vanished. Clever way they make these space bombs nowadays. A few minutes
previous the boys had been tearing up old Amazings and throwing them at
one another, but now they contented themselves with tearing up just the
editors. Palmer was torn in half and he sat in a corner arguing with
himself about rejecting a story for an hour before someone put him
through an orange juice machine killing him. (Orange juice sorry, now?)</p>

<p>And then they landed on Venus. How in heck they got back there so quick
is a wonder of science, but there they were. "Come on, girls!" cried
Quelch, "put on your shin guards, get out there and dig ditches for good
old W.P.A. and the Rover Boys Academy, earth branch 27!"</p>

<p>Out into the staggering rain they dashed. Five minutes later they came
back in, gasping, reeling. They had forgotten their corsets! The
Venusians closed in like a million land-lords. "Charge, men!" cried
Quelch, running the other way. And then&mdash;BATTLE! "What a fight; folks,"
cried Quelch. "Twenty thousand earth men against two Venusians! We're
outnumbered, but we'll fight!" BLOOSH! "Correction&mdash;ten thousand men
fighting!" KERBLOM! "One hundred men from earth left!" BOOM! "This is
the last man speaking, folks! What a fight. I ain't had so much fun
since&mdash;Help, someone just clipped my corset strings!" BWOM! "Someone
just clipped me!"</p>

<p>The field was silent. The ship lay gleaming in the pink light of dawn
that was just blooming over the mountains like a pale flower. The two
Venusians stood weeping over the bodies of the Earthlings like onion
peelers or two women in a bargain basement. One Venusian looked at the
other Venusian, and in a high-pitched, hoarse, sad voice said: "Aye,
aye, aye&mdash;THIS&mdash;HIT SHOODEN HEPPEN TO A DOG&mdash;NOT A DOIDY LEEDLE DOG!"
And dawn came peacefully, like beer barrels, rolling.</p>

</div>


<p>"LORD! HE'S THERE AGAIN! HE'S THERE! LOOK!" the old man croaked, jabbing
a calloused finger at the burial hill. "Old Piper again! As crazy as a
loon! Every year that way!"</p>

<p>The Martian boy at the feet of the old man stirred his thin reddish feet
in the soil and affixed his large green eyes upon the burial hill where
the Piper stood. "Why does he do that?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Ah?" The old man's leathery face rumpled into a maze of wrinkles. "He's
crazy, that's what. Stands up there piping on his music from sunset
until dawn."</p>

<p>The thin piping sounds squealed in the dusk, echoed back from the low
hills, were lost in melancholy silence, fading. Then louder, higher,
insanely, crying with shrill voice.</p>

<p>The Piper was a tall, gaunt man, face as pale and wan as Martian moons,
eyes electrical purple, standing against the soft of the dusking heaven,
holding his pipe to his lips, playing. The Piper&mdash;a silhouette&mdash;a
symbol&mdash;a melody.</p>

<p>"Where did the Piper come from?" asked the Martian boy.</p>

<p>"From Venus." The old man took out his pipe and filled it. "Oh, some
twenty years ago or more, on the projectile with the Terrestrians. I
arrived on the same ship, coming from Earth, we shared a double seat
together."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" Again the boyish, eager voice.</p>

<p>"I can't remember. I don't think I ever knew, really."</p>

<p>A vague rustling sound came into existence. The Piper continued playing,
paying no heed to it. From the darkness, across the star-jewelled
horizon, came mysterious shapes, creeping, creeping.</p>

<p>"Mars is a dying world," the old man said. "Nothing ever happens of much
gravity. The Piper, I believe, is an exile."</p>

<p>The stars trembled like reflections in water, dancing with the music.</p>

<p>"An exile." The old man continued. "Something like a leper. They called
him THE BRILLIANT. He was the epitome of all Venerian culture until the
Earthmen came with their greedy incorporations and licentious harlots.
The Earthlings outlawed him, sent him here to Mars to live out his
days."</p>

<p>"Mars is a dying world," repeated the boy. "A dying world. How many
Martians are there, sir?"</p>

<p>The old man chuckled. "I guess maybe you are the last pure Martian
alive, boy. But there are millions of others."</p>

<p>"Where do they live? I have never seen them."</p>

<p>"You are young. You have much to see, much to learn."</p>

<p>"Where do they live?"</p>

<p>"Out there, beyond the mountains, beyond the dead sea bottoms, over the
horizon and to the north, in the caves, far back in the subterrane."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? Now that's hard to say. They were a brilliant race once upon a
time. But something happened to them, hybrided them. They are
unintelligent creatures now, cruel beasts."</p>

<p>"Does Earth own Mars?" The little boy's eyes were riveted upon the
glowing planet overhead, the green planet.</p>

<p>"Yes, all of Mars. Earth has three cities here, each containing one
thousand people. The closest city is a mile from here, down the road, a
group of small metal bubble-like buildings. The men from Earth move
about among the buildings like ants enclosed in their space suits. They
are miners. With their huge machines they rip open the bowels of our
planet and dig out our precious life-blood from the mineral arteries."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That is all." The old man shook his head sadly. "No culture, no art, no
purpose. Greedy, hopeless Earthlings."</p>

<p>"And the other two cities&mdash;&mdash;where are they?"</p>

<p>"One is up the same cobbled road five miles, the third is further still
by some five hundred miles."</p>

<p>"I am glad I live here with you, alone." The boy's head nodded sleepily.
"I do not like the men from Terra. They are despoilers."</p>

<p>"They have always been. But someday," said the old man, "they will meet
their doom. They have blasphemed enough, have they. They cannot <i>own</i>
planets as they have and expect nothing but greedy luxury for their
sluggishly squat bodies. Someday&mdash;&mdash;!" His voice rose high, in tempo and
pitch with the Piper's wild music.</p>

<p>Wild music, insane music, stirring music. Music to stir the savage into
life. Music to effect man's destiny!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wild-eyed Piper on the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying out your rigadoons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring the savages to kill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath the waning Martian moons!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"What is that?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"A poem," said the old man. "A poem I have written in the last few days.
I feel something is going to happen very soon. The Piper's song is
growing more insistent every night. At first, twenty years ago, he
played on only a few nights of every year, but now, for the last three
years he has played until dawn every night of every autumn when the
planet is dying."</p>

<p>"Bring the savages?" the boy sat up. "What savages?"</p>

<p>"There!"</p>

<p>Along the star-glimmered mountain tops a vast clustering herd of black,
murmuring, advancing. The music screamed higher and higher.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Piper, pipe that song again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he piped, I wept to hear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"More of the poem?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Not my poem&mdash;but a poem from Earth some seventy years ago. I learned it
in school."</p>

<p>"Music is strange." The little boy's eyes were scintillant with thought.
"It warms me inside. This music makes me angry. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it is music with a purpose."</p>

<p>"What purpose?"</p>

<p>"We shall know by dawn.</p>

<p>"Music is the language of all things&mdash;intelligent or not, savage or
educated civilian. This Piper knows his music as a god knows his heaven.
For twenty years he has composed his hymn of action and hate and
finally, tonight perhaps, the finale will be reached. At first, many
years ago, when he played, he received no answer from the subterrane,
but the murmur of gibbering voices. Five years ago he lured the voices
and the creatures from their caves to the mountain tops. Tonight, for
the first time, the herd of black will spill over the trails toward our
hovel, toward the road, toward the cities of man!"</p>

<p>Music screaming, higher, faster, insanely, sending shock after macabre
shock thru night air, loosening the stars from their riveted stations.
The Piper stretched high, six feet or more, upon his hillock, swaying
back and forth, his thin shape attired in brown-cloth. The black mass on
the mountain came down like amoebic tentacles, met and coalesced,
muttering and mumbling. "Go inside and hide," said the old man. "You are
young, you must live to propagate the new Mars. Tonight is the end of
the old, tomorrow begins the new! It is death for the men of Earth!"
Higher still and higher. "Death! They come to overrun the Earthlings,
destroy their cities, take their projectiles. Then&mdash;in the ships of
man&mdash;to Earth! Turnabout! Revolution and Revenge! A new civilization!
When monsters usurp men and men's greediness crumbles at his demise!"
Shriller, faster, higher, insanely tempoed. "The Piper&mdash;The Brilliant
One&mdash;He who has waited for years for this night. Back to Venus to
reinstall the glory of his civilization! The return of Art to humanity!"</p>

<p>"But they are savages, these unpure Martians," the boy cried.</p>

<p>"Men are savages. I am ashamed of being a man," the old man said,
tremblingly. "Yes, these creatures are savages, but they will
learn&mdash;these brutes&mdash;with music. Music in many forms&mdash;&mdash;music for peace,
music for love&mdash;music for hate and music for death. The Piper and his
brood will set up a new cosmos. He is immortal!" Now, hurrying,
muttering up the road, the first cluster of black things reminiscent of
men. A strange sharp odor in the air. The Piper, from his hillock,
walking down the road, over the cobbles, to the city. "Piper, pipe that
song again!" cried the old man. "Go and kill and live again! Bring us
love and art again! Piper, pipe the song! I weep!" Then: "Hide, child,
hide quickly! Before they come! Hurry!" And the child, crying, hurried
to the small house and hid himself thru the night.</p>

<p>Swirling, jumping, running, leaping, gamboling, crying&mdash;the new humanity
surged to man's cities, his rockets, his mines. The Piper's song! Stars
shuddered. Winds stilled. Nightbirds sang no songs. Echoes murmured only
the voices of the ones who advanced, bringing new understanding. The old
man, caught in the whirlpool of ebon, was swept down, screaming. Then up
the road, by the awful thousands, vomiting out of hills, sprawling from
caves, curling, huge fingers of beasts, around and about and down to the
Man Cities. Sighing, leaping up, voices and destruction!</p>

<p>Rockets across the sky!</p>

<p>Guns. Death.</p>

<p>And finally, in the pale advancement of dawn, the memory, the echoing of
the old man's voice. And the little boy arose to start afresh a new
world with a new mate.</p>

<p>Echoing, the old man's voice:</p>

<p>"Piper, pipe that song again! So he piped, I wept to hear!"</p>

<p>A new day dawned.</p>


<p>The End</p>

<h1>A Little Journey</h1>
<p>There were two important things&mdash;one, that she was very old; two, that
Mr. Thirkell was taking her to God. For hadn't he patted her hand and
said: "Mrs. Bellowes, we'll take off into space in my rocket, and go
to find Him together."</p>

<p>And that was how it was going to be. Oh, this wasn't like any other
group Mrs. Bellowes had ever joined. In her fervor to light a path for
her delicate, tottering feet, she had struck matches down dark alleys,
and found her way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry
eyelashes over crystal balls. She had walked on the meadow paths with
ascetic Indian philosophers imported by daughters-in-spirit of Madame
Blavatsky. She had made pilgrimages to California's stucco jungles
to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat. She had even
consented to signing away the rights to one of her homes in order to be
taken into the shouting order of a temple of amazing evangelists who
had promised her golden smoke, crystal fire, and the great soft hand of
God coming to bear her home.</p>

<p>None of these people had ever shaken Mrs. Bellowes' faith, even when
she saw them sirened away in a black wagon in the night, or discovered
their pictures, bleak and unromantic, in the morning tabloids. The
world had roughed them up and locked them away because they knew too
much, that was all.</p>

<p>And then, two weeks ago, she had seen Mr. Thirkell's advertisement in
New York City:</p>

<p class="ph3">COME TO MARS!</p>

<p class="ph4">Stay at the Thirkell Restorium for one week. And then,<br />
on into space on the greatest adventure life can offer!</p>

<p class="ph4">Send for Free Pamphlet: "Nearer My God To Thee."</p>

<p class="ph4">Excursion rates. Round trip slightly lower.</p>

<p>"Round trip," Mrs. Bellowes had thought. "But who would come back after
seeing <i>Him</i>?"</p>

<p>And so she had bought a ticket and flown off to Mars and spent seven
mild days at Mr. Thirkell's Restorium, the building with the sign on it
which flashed: THIRKELL'S ROCKET TO HEAVEN! She had spent the
week bathing in limpid waters and erasing the care from her tiny bones,
and now she was fidgeting, ready to be loaded into Mr. Thirkell's own
special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space
beyond Jupiter and Saturn and Pluto. And thus&mdash;who could deny it?&mdash;you
would be getting nearer and nearer to the Lord. How wonderful! Couldn't
you just <i>feel</i> Him drawing near? Couldn't you just sense His breath,
His scrutiny, His Presence?</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Mrs. Bellowes, "an ancient rickety elevator, ready to
go up the shaft. God need only press the button."</p>

<p>Now, on the seventh day, as she minced up the steps of the Restorium, a
number of small doubts assailed her.</p>

<p>"For one thing," she said aloud to no one, "it isn't quite the land of
milk and honey here on Mars that they said it would be. My room is like
a cell, the swimming pool is really quite inadequate, and, besides, how
many widows who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim? And,
finally, the whole Restorium smells of boiled cabbage and tennis shoes!"</p>

<p>She opened the front door and let it slam, somewhat irritably.</p>

<p>She was amazed at the other women in the auditorium. It was like
wandering in a carnival mirror-maze, coming again and again upon
yourself&mdash;the same floury face, the same chicken hands, and jingling
bracelets. One after another of the images of herself floated before
her. She put out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady
shaking her fingers and saying:</p>

<p>"We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. <i>Sh!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah," whispered everyone.</p>

<p>The velvet curtains parted.</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes upon
everyone. But there was something, nevertheless, in his appearance
which made one expect him to call "Hi!" while fuzzy dogs jumped over
his legs, through his hooped arms, and over his back. Then, dogs and
all, he should dance with a dazzling piano-keyboard smile off into the
wings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellowes, with a secret part of her mind which she constantly had
to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese gong sound when Mr.
Thirkell entered. His large liquid dark eyes were so improbable that
one of the old ladies had facetiously claimed she saw a mosquito cloud
hovering over them as they did around summer rain-barrels. And Mrs.
Bellowes sometimes caught the scent of the theatrical mothball and the
smell of calliope steam on his sharply pressed suit.</p>

<p>But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all other
disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion and
whispered, "This time it's <i>real</i>. This time it'll work. Haven't we got
a <i>rocket</i>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled a sudden Comedy Mask smile. The old
ladies looked in at his epiglottis and sensed chaos there.</p>

<p>Before he even began to speak, Mrs. Bellowes saw him picking up each of
his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. Her heart
squeezed in like a tiny fist, and she gritted her porcelain teeth.</p>

<p>"Friends," said Mr. Thirkell, and you could hear the frost snap in the
hearts of the entire assemblage.</p>

<p>"No!" said Mrs. Bellowes ahead of time. She could hear the bad news
rushing at her, and herself tied to the track while the immense black
wheels threatened and the whistle screamed, helpless.</p>

<p>"There will be a slight delay," said Mr. Thirkell.</p>

<p>In the next instant, Mr. Thirkell might have cried, or been tempted to
cry, "Ladies, be seated!" in minstrel-fashion, for the ladies had come
up at him from their chairs, protesting and trembling.</p>

<p>"Not a very long delay." Mr. Thirkell put up his hands to pat the air.</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"Only a week."</p>

<p>"A week!"</p>

<p>"Yes. You can stay here at the Restorium for seven more days, can't
you? A little delay won't matter, will it, in the end? You've waited a
lifetime. Only a few more days."</p>

<p><i>At twenty dollars a day</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes, coldly.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" a woman cried.</p>

<p>"A legal difficulty," said Mr. Thirkell.</p>

<p>"We've a rocket, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Well, ye-ess."</p>

<p>"But I've been here a whole month, waiting," said one old lady.
"Delays, delays!"</p>

<p>"That's right," said everyone.</p>

<p>"Ladies, ladies," murmured Mr. Thirkell, smiling serenely.</p>

<p>"We want to see the rocket!" It was Mrs. Bellowes forging ahead,
alone, brandishing her fist like a toy hammer.</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell looked into the old ladies' eyes, a missionary among
albino cannibals.</p>

<p>"Well, now," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>now</i>!" cried Mrs. Bellowes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"So am I!" she said. "That's why we want to see the ship!"</p>

<p>"No, no, now, Mrs.&mdash;" He snapped his fingers for her name.</p>

<p>"Bellowes!" she cried. She was a small container, but now all the
seething pressures that had been built up over long years came
steaming through the delicate vents of her body. Her cheeks became
incandescent. With a wail that was like a melancholy factory whistle,
Mrs. Bellowes ran forward and hung to him, almost by her teeth, like a
summer-maddened Spitz. She would not and never could let go, until he
died, and the other women followed, jumping and yapping like a pound
let loose on its trainer, the same one who had petted them and to whom
they had squirmed and whined joyfully an hour before, now milling about
him, creasing his sleeves and frightening the Egyptian serenity from
his gaze.</p>

<p>"This way!" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. "Through
the back! We've waited long enough to see the ship. Every day he's put
us off, every day we've waited, now let's see."</p>

<p>"No, no, ladies!" cried Mr. Thirkell, leaping about.</p>

<p>They burst through the back of the stage and out a door, like a flood,
bearing the poor man with them into a shed, and then out, quite
suddenly, into an abandoned gymnasium.</p>

<p>"There it is!" said someone. "The rocket."</p>

<p>And then a silence fell that was terrible to entertain.</p>

<p>There was the rocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellowes looked at it and her hands sagged away from Mr.
Thirkell's collar.</p>

<p>The rocket was something like a battered copper pot. There were a
thousand bulges and rents and rusty pipes and dirty vents on and in it.
The ports were clouded over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind
hog.</p>

<p>Everyone wailed a little sighing wail.</p>

<p>"Is that the rocket ship <i>Glory Be to the Highest</i>?" cried Mrs.
Bellowes, appalled.</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell nodded and looked at his feet.</p>

<p>"For which we paid out our one thousand dollars apiece and came all the
way to Mars to get on board with you and go off to find Him?" asked
Mrs. Bellowes.</p>

<p>"Why, that isn't worth a sack of dried peas," said Mrs. Bellowes.</p>

<p>"It's nothing but junk!"</p>

<p><i>Junk</i>, whispered everyone, getting hysterical.</p>

<p>"Don't let him get away!"</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell tried to break and run, but a thousand possum traps closed
on him from every side. He withered.</p>

<p>Everybody walked around in circles like blind mice. There was a
confusion and a weeping that lasted for five minutes as they went over
and touched the Rocket, the Dented Kettle, the Rusty Container for
God's Children.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Bellowes. She stepped up into the askew doorway of
the rocket and faced everyone. "It looks as if a terrible thing has
been done to us," she said. "I haven't any money to go back home to
Earth and I've too much pride to go to the Government and tell them
a common man like this has fooled us out of our life's savings. I
don't know how you feel about it, all of you, but the reason all of us
came is because I'm eighty-five, and you're eighty-nine, and you're
seventy-eight, and all of us are nudging on toward a hundred, and
there's nothing on Earth for us, and it doesn't appear there's anything
on Mars either. We all expected not to breathe much more air or crochet
many more doilies or we'd never have come here. So what I have to
propose is a simple thing&mdash;to take a chance."</p>

<p>She reached out and touched the rusted hulk of the rocket.</p>

<p>"This is <i>our</i> rocket. We paid for our trip. And we're going to <i>take</i>
our trip!"</p>

<p>Everyone rustled and stood on tiptoes and opened an astonished mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell began to cry. He did it quite easily and very effectively.</p>

<p>"We're going to get in this ship," said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him.
"And we're going to take off to where we were going."</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell stopped crying long enough to say, "But it was all a fake.
I don't know anything about space. He's not out there, anyway. I lied.
I don't know where He is, and I couldn't find Him if I wanted to. And
you were fools to ever take my word on it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Bellowes, "we were fools. I'll go along on that. But
you can't blame us, for we're old, and it was a lovely, good and fine
idea, one of the loveliest ideas in the world. Oh, we didn't really
fool ourselves that we could get nearer to Him physically. It was the
gentle, mad dream of old people, the kind of thing you hold onto for a
few minutes a day, even though you know it's not true. So, all of you
who want to go, you follow me in the ship."</p>

<p>"But you can't go!" said Mr. Thirkell. "You haven't got a navigator.
And that ship's a ruin!"</p>

<p>"You," said Mrs. Bellowes, "will be the navigator."</p>

<p>She stepped into the ship, and after a moment, the other old ladies
pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically,
was nevertheless pressed through the port, and in a minute the door
slammed shut. Mr. Thirkell was strapped into the navigator's seat, with
everyone talking at once and holding him down. The special helmets
were issued to be fitted over every gray or white head to supply extra
oxygen in case of a leakage in the ship's hull, and at long last the
hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell and said,
"We're ready, sir."</p>

<p>He said nothing. He pleaded with them silently, using his great, dark,
wet eyes, but Mrs. Bellowes shook her head and pointed to the control.</p>

<p>"Takeoff," agreed Mr. Thirkell morosely, and pulled a switch.</p>

<p>Everybody fell. The rocket went up from the planet Mars in a great
fiery glide, with the noise of an entire kitchen thrown down an
elevator shaft, with a sound of pots and pans and kettles and fires
boiling and stews bubbling, with a smell of burned incense and
rubber and sulphur, with a color of yellow fire, and a ribbon of red
stretching below them, and all the old women singing and holding
to each other, and Mrs. Bellowes crawling upright in the sighing,
straining, trembling ship.</p>

<p>"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell."</p>

<p>"It can't last," said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. "This ship can't last. It
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>It did.</p>

<p>The rocket exploded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like a
doll. She heard the great screamings and saw the flashes of bodies
sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery light.</p>

<p>"Help, help!" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio beam.</p>

<p>The ship disintegrated into a million parts, and the old ladies,
all one hundred of them, were flung straight on ahead with the same
velocity as the ship.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Thirkell, for some reason of trajectory, perhaps, he had
been blown out the other side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes saw him
falling separate and away from them, screaming, screaming.</p>

<p><i>There goes Mr. Thirkell</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes.</p>

<p>And she knew where he was going. He was going to be burned and roasted
and broiled good, but very good.</p>

<p>Mr. Thirkell was falling down into the Sun.</p>

<p><i>And here we are</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes. <i>Here we are, going on out,
and out, and out.</i></p>

<p>There was hardly a sense of motion at all, but she knew that she was
traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would continue to travel
at that speed for an eternity, until....</p>

<p>She saw the other women swinging all about her in their own
trajectories, a few minutes of oxygen left to each of them in their
helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going.</p>

<p><i>Of course</i>, thought Mrs. Bellowes. <i>Out into space. Out and out, and
the darkness like a great church, and the stars like candles, and in
spite of everything, Mr. Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we
are going toward the Lord.</i></p>

<p>And there, yes, <i>there</i>, as she fell on and on, coming toward her,
she could almost discern the outline now, coming toward her was His
mighty golden hand, reaching down to hold her and comfort her like a
frightened sparrow....</p>

<p>"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes," she said quietly, in her best company
voice. "I'm from the planet Earth."</p>

<h1>The Monster Maker</h1>
<p>Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get
scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening
to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a
damned sweet picture of everything that was happening.</p>

<p>The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,
wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the
dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this
meteor coming like blazing fury.</p>

<p>Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's
skin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the
rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.</p>

<p>There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was
picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't
long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to
his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had
been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of
the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.</p>

<p>It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids
rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a
tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.</p>

<p>Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the
nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you
ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of
metal death. What a fade-out!</p>

<p>"Irish!" he heard himself say. "Is this IT?"</p>

<p>"Is this <i>what</i>?" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.</p>

<p>"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?"</p>

<p>Marnagan fumed. "I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm
ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!"</p>

<p>They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of
gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.</p>

<p>The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over
and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled
around&mdash;human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,
air and energy flung out.</p>

<p>Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking
quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach
film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like <i>this</i> one! His
brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his
camera.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Silence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.
Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked
to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold
that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the
wreckage into that silence.</p>

<p>He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his
fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,
thinking "Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven
feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.</p>

<p>"Hold it!" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera
whirred. "Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed
from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!"</p>

<p>"From the toe of me boot!" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders
flexed inside his vac-suit. "I might've died in there, and you nursin'
that film-contraption!"</p>

<p>Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. "I never thought of that.
Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always
have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to." Hathaway
stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he
couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,
pale. "Where are we?"</p>

<p>"A million miles from nobody."</p>

<p>They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that
stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.
Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look
sick.</p>

<p>"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking
hands the other side of this rock in two hours." Marnagan shook his mop
of dusty red hair. "And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd
capture that Gunther lad!"</p>

<p>His voice stopped and the silence spoke.</p>

<p>Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. "I checked
my oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left."</p>

<p>The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric
rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply
mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or <i>was</i>
suffocation a better death...? <i>Sixty minutes.</i></p>

<p>They stood and looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Damn that meteor!" said Marnagan, hotly.</p>

<p>Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:
"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked
it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.
Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've
got it here, on film."</p>

<p>Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. "It's not proof we need
now, Click. Oxygen. And then <i>food</i>. And then some way back to Earth."</p>

<p>Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: "This is Gunther's work. He's
here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.
Oh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back
to Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate
whose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins
through to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by
yours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a
bony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't
much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.</p>

<p>Marnagan said, "We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat
with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got
fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that&mdash;right or wrong&mdash;you'll
be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all
you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any
words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about
it. As for me&mdash;" he twisted his glossy red face. "Keeping alive is me
hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order."</p>

<p>Click nodded. "Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.
It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and
the crash this way."</p>

<p>Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far
down, and the green eyes blazed.</p>

<p>They stopped, together.</p>

<p>"Oops!" Click said.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Marnagan blinked. "Did you feel <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and
limbless, suddenly. "Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!"</p>

<p>They ran back. "Let's try it again."</p>

<p>They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.
"Gravity should not act this way, Click."</p>

<p>"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that&mdash;it's Gunther! No
wonder we fell so fast&mdash;we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!
Gunther'd do anything to&mdash;did I say <i>anything</i>?"</p>

<p>Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand
came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable
horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with
numerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some
tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along
in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.</p>

<p>Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke
cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed
after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in
Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt
the creatures at all.</p>

<p>"Irish!" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline
toward the mouth a small cave. "This way, fella!"</p>

<p>Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. "They're
too big; they can't get us in here!" Click's voice gasped it out,
as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.
Instinctively, Hathaway added, "Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a
scene!"</p>

<p>"Damn your damn camera!" yelled Marnagan. "They might come in!"</p>

<p>"Use your gun."</p>

<p>"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,
eh, Click?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Sure. <i>You</i> enjoyed it, every moment of it."</p>

<p>"I did that." Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. "Now, what
will we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?"</p>

<p>"Let me think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt
funny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters
and Gunther and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which one will you be having?" asked Irish, casually. "A red one or a
blue one?"</p>

<p>Hathaway laughed nervously. "A pink one with yellow ruffles&mdash;Good God,
now you've got <i>me</i> doing it. Joking in the face of death."</p>

<p>"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck."</p>

<p>That didn't please the photographer. "I'm an Anglo-Swede," he pointed
out.</p>

<p>Marnagan shifted uneasily. "Here, now. You're doing nothing but
sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take
me a profile shot of the beasties and myself."</p>

<p>Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. "What in hell's the use? All
this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it."</p>

<p>"Then," retorted Marnagan, "we'll develop it for our own benefit; while
waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our
rescue!"</p>

<p>Hathaway snorted. "U.S. Cavalry."</p>

<p>Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. "Snap me this pose," he
said. "I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,
my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace
negotiations betwixt me and these pixies."</p>

<p>Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver
for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running
around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but
his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of
Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.</p>

<p>Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling
for the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without
much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death
wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying
anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they
had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.</p>

<p>When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it
up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:</p>

<p>"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt
back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,
what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space
war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory
is lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which
dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?
Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.
It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes
unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces."</p>

<p>Marnagan rumbled. "Where is the dirty son, then!"</p>

<p>"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent&mdash;them." Hathaway nodded at
the beasts. "People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from
wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that&mdash;the animals
tend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle
his attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the
Patrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,
then."</p>

<p>"I don't see no Base around."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Click shrugged. "Still doubt it? Okay. Look." He tapped his camera and
a spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped
it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it
developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing
film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,
leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the
impressions. Quick stuff.</p>

<p>Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,
Click handed the whole thing over. "Look."</p>

<p>Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. "Ah,
Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid
monsters complete."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:
Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally
with <i>nothing</i>; Marnagan shooting his gun at <i>nothing</i>; Marnagan
pretending to be happy in front of <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>Then, closeup&mdash;of&mdash;NOTHING!</p>

<p>The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair
like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.
Maybe&mdash;</p>

<p>Hathaway said it, loud: "Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this
mess! Here&mdash;"</p>

<p>He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,
the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the
monsters weren't there, they weren't there.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Marnagan. "But step outside this cave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid," said Click.</p>

<p>Marnagan scowled. "You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or
infra-red or something that won't come out on film?"</p>

<p>"Nuts! Any color <i>we</i> see, the camera sees. We've been fooled."</p>

<p>"Hey, where <i>you</i> going?" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man
tried pushing past him.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way," said Hathaway.</p>

<p>Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. "If anyone is going anywhere,
it'll be me does the going."</p>

<p>"I can't let you do that, Irish."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd be going on my say-so."</p>

<p>"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand
aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their
bones." He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist
except under an inch of porous metal plate. "Your express purpose on
this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later
for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand
education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me
profile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The
Lion's Den."</p>

<p>"Irish, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up and load up."</p>

<p>Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.</p>

<p>"Ready, Click?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess so," said Hathaway. "And remember, think it hard, Irish.
Think it hard. There aren't any animals&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep me in focus, lad."</p>

<p>"All the way, Irish."</p>

<p>"What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!"</p>

<p>Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,
two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were
waiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.</p>

<p>Right out into the middle of them....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the
monsters!</p>

<p>Only now it was only Marnagan.</p>

<p>No more monsters.</p>

<p>Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. "Hey, Click, look
at me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and
ran away!"</p>

<p>"Ran, hell!" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and
animated. "They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative
figments!"</p>

<p>"And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you
coward!"</p>

<p>"Smile when you say that, Irish."</p>

<p>"Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in
your sweet grey eyes?"</p>

<p>"Damn," swore the photographer, embarrassedly. "Why don't they put
window-wipers in these helmets?"</p>

<p>"I'll take it up with the Board, lad."</p>

<p>"Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one
hunk, I couldn't help&mdash;Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part
of his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back
into their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing
suspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals
kill them."</p>

<p>"Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill."</p>

<p>"Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could
have frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If
that isn't being dangerous&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Irishman whistled.</p>

<p>"But, we've got to <i>move</i>, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.
In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,
Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters." Click
attached his camera to his mid-belt. "Gunther probably thinks we're
dead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never
had a chance to disbelieve them."</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident&mdash;" Click
stopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and
felt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady
himself, and swayed. "I&mdash;I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.
This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick."</p>

<p>Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. "Hold tight, Click. The
guy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach."</p>

<p>"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals
came from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come
back!"</p>

<p>"Come back? How?"</p>

<p>"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we
believe in them again, they'll return."</p>

<p>Marnagan didn't like it. "Won't&mdash;won't they kill us&mdash;if they come&mdash;if
we believe in 'em?"</p>

<p>Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. "Not if we believe
in them to a <i>certain point</i>. Psychologically they can both be seen and
felt. We only want to <i>see</i> them coming at us again."</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> we, now?"</p>

<p>"With twenty minutes left, maybe less&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?"</p>

<p>Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. "Just think&mdash;I will see
the monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.
Think it over and over."</p>

<p>Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. "And&mdash;what if I forget to remember
all that? What if I get excited...?"</p>

<p>Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at
Irish.</p>

<p>Marnagan cursed. "All right, lad. Let's have at it!"</p>

<p>The monsters returned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming
in malevolent anticipation about the two men.</p>

<p>"This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a
sending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!"</p>

<p>Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted
faces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" width="394" height="500" alt=""/>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and
raised his gun and made quick moves with it. "Click! This one here!
It's real!" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense
frame slammed against rock, noiselessly.</p>

<p>Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the
helmet glass with his hands, shouting:</p>

<p>"Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real&mdash;don't let it force into
your mind! It's not real, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Click&mdash;" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.
"Click&mdash;" He was fighting hard. "I&mdash;I&mdash;sure now. Sure&mdash;" He smiled.
"It&mdash;it's only a shanty fake!"</p>

<p>"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up."</p>

<p>Marnagan's thick lips opened. "It's only a fake," he said. And then,
irritated, "Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!"</p>

<p>Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and
little bubbles danced in his eyes. "Irish, <i>you</i> forget the monsters.
Let me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might
forget."</p>

<p>Marnagan showed his teeth. "Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And
besides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty."</p>

<p>The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.
Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.</p>

<p>"We'll be taking our chances on guard," hissed Irish. "I'll go ahead,
draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then, <i>you</i> show up with
<i>your</i> gun...."</p>

<p>"I haven't got one."</p>

<p>"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They
probably got scanners out. Let them see me&mdash;"</p>

<p>And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about
five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved
up, and there was a door opening in the rock.</p>

<p>His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. "A
door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!"</p>

<p>Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the
thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.</p>

<p>Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.</p>

<p>"All right, put 'em up!" a new harsh voice cried over a different
radio. One of Gunther's guards.</p>

<p>Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.</p>

<p>The strange harsh voice said, "That's better. Don't try and pick that
gun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.
How'd you get past the animals?"</p>

<p>Click started running. He switched off his <i>sending</i> audio, kept his
<i>receiving</i> on. Marnagan, weaponless. <i>One</i> guard. Click gasped. Things
were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running
and listening to Marnagan's lying voice:</p>

<p>"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles
and stacked them up to dry, ya louse!" Marnagan said. "But, damn you,
they killed my partner before he had a chance!"</p>

<p>The guard laughed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head
swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He
let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't
have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!</p>

<p>A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that
yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,
air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a
proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard
had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: "I think I'll let
you stand right there and die," he said quietly. "That what Gunther
wanted, anway. A nice sordid death."</p>

<p>Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.</p>

<p>"Don't move!" he snapped. "I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One
twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind
you! Freeze!"</p>

<p>The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped
his gun to the floor.</p>

<p>"Get his gun, Irish."</p>

<p>Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.</p>

<p>Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. "Thanks for
posing," he said. "That shot will go down in film history for candid
acting."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door
leading into the Base?"</p>

<p>The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.</p>

<p>Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.
"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double
time! Double!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on
their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,
hid him in a huge trash receptacle. "Where he belongs," observed Irish
tersely.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing
more than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.
Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was
short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to
rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for
cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the
swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't
wanted. They were scared off.</p>

<p>The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of
intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film
with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them
into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.</p>

<p>"So here we are, still not much better off than we were," growled
Irish. "We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn
up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the
monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?"</p>

<p>"What good would that do?" Hathaway gnawed his lip. "They wouldn't fool
the engineers who created them, you nut."</p>

<p>Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. "Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come
riding over the hill&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Irish!" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. "Irish. The U.S.
Cavalry it is!" His eyes darted over the machines. "Here. Help me.
We'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century."</p>

<p>Marnagan winced. "You breathing oxygen or whiskey?"</p>

<p>"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture
of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face
when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an
actor are you?"</p>

<p>"That's a silly question."</p>

<p>"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of
you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart
and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down
and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula...."</p>

<p>An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a
sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,
lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a
wide, green-lawned Plaza.</p>

<p>Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked
across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that
was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.</p>

<p>He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.</p>

<p>He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and
pushed him into a room where Gunther sat.</p>

<p>Hathaway looked at him. "So you're Gunther?" he said, calmly. The
pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,
questioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of
metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he
could speak, Hathaway said:</p>

<p>"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and
we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men
against your eighty-five."</p>

<p>Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands
twitched in his lap. "You are bluffing," he said, finally, with a firm
directness. "A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the
last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being
pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed."</p>

<p>"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther."</p>

<p>A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging
on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and
started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side
of his office. He stared, hard.</p>

<p>The Patrol was coming!</p>

<p>Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.
Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis
guns with them in their tight hands.</p>

<p>Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.
"Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!"</p>

<p>Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway
had to credit them on that. They took it, standing.</p>

<p>Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.
His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him
from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was
throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his
fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.</p>

<p>Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three
of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and
twitch. God, what photography!</p>

<p>Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He
fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.
Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos
taking place immediately outside his window.</p>

<p>The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And
out of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, "Here!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the Patrolmen stopped firing, and ran toward Click and the
Building. He got inside. "Did you see them run, Click boy? What an
idea. How did we do?"</p>

<p>"Fine, Irish. Fine!"</p>

<p>"So here's Gunther, the spalpeen! Gunther, the little dried up pirate,
eh?" Marnagan whacked Hathaway on the back. "I'll have to hand it to
you, this is the best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I was to
fight with such splendid men as these&mdash;" He gestured toward the Plaza.</p>

<p>Click laughed with him. "You should be proud. Five hundred Patrolmen
with hair like red banners flying, with thick Irish brogues and broad
shoulders and freckles and blue eyes and a body as tall as your
stories!"</p>

<p>Marnagan roared. "I always said, I said&mdash;if ever there could be an
army of Marnagans, we could lick the whole damn uneeverse! Did you
photograph it, Click?"</p>

<p>"I did." Hathaway tapped his camera happily.</p>

<p>"Ah, then, won't that be a scoop for you, boy? Money from the Patrol so
they can use the film as instruction in Classes and money from Cosmic
Films for the news-reel headlines! And what a scene, and what acting!
Five hundred duplicates of Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically
into the minds of the pirates, walking across a Plaza, capturing the
whole she-bang! How did you like my death-scenes?"</p>

<p>"You're a ham. And anyway&mdash;five hundred duplicates, nothing!" said
Click. He ripped the film-spool from the camera, spread it in the air
to develop, inserted it in the micro-viewer. "Have a look&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marnagan looked. "Ah, now. Ah, now," he said over and over. "There's
the Plaza, and there's Gunther's men fighting and then they're turning
and running. And what are they running from? One man! Me. Irish
Marnagan! Walking all by myself across the lawn, paralyzing them. One
against a hundred, and the cowards running from me!</p>

<p>"Sure, Click, this is better than I thought. I forgot that the film
wouldn't register telepathic emanations, them other Marnagans. It
makes it look like I'm a mighty brave man, does it not? It does. Ah,
look&mdash;look at me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute of it, I am."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hathaway swatted him on his back-side. "Look here, you egocentric son
of Erin, there's more work to be done. More pirates to be captured. The
Patrol is still marching around and someone might be suspicious if they
looked too close and saw all that red hair."</p>

<p>"All right, Click, we'll clean up the rest of them now. We're a
combination, we two, we are. I take it all back about your pictures,
Click, if you hadn't thought of taking pictures of me and inserting
it into those telepath machines we'd be dead ducks now. Well&mdash;here I
go...."</p>

<p>Hathaway stopped him. "Hold it. Until I load my camera again."</p>

<p>Irish grinned. "Hurry it up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed.
I think I'll handle them with me fists for a change. The gentle art of
uppercuts. Are you ready, Hathaway?"</p>

<p>"Ready."</p>

<p>Marnagan lifted his big ham-fists.</p>

<p>The camera whirred. Hathaway chuckled, to himself.</p>

<p>What a sweet fade-out this was!</p>

<h1>Morgue Ship</h1>
<p>He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws
groping into space, and then the star-port closed.</p>

<p>There was another dead man aboard the <i>Constellation</i>.</p>

<p>Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and
quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him;
machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see
anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of
the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet,
keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.</p>

<p>Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical
gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all
tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship.
Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor
warrior's body out of the void.</p>

<p>He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and
forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back
full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke,
who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a
decent burial.</p>

<p>"Number ninety-eight." Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice
from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.</p>

<p>"Number ninety-eight," Burnett repeated. "Working on ninety-five,
ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight
surgery." Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded
deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.</p>

<p>Rice said:</p>

<p>"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day
drunk!"</p>

<p>Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them
into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and
shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one
another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships,
salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.</p>

<p>Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred
other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.</p>

<p>Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots
inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the
husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved
for action.</p>

<p>This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!</p>

<p>"Sam!"</p>

<p>Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative
lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator
shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to
life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.</p>

<p>"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!"</p>

<p>Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was
worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred
thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood
cooling in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed
up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed
without making any noise on the rungs.</p>

<p>He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget.</p>

<p><i>You never catch up with the war.</i></p>

<p>All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across
stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the
titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited
glory are always a million miles ahead.</p>

<p>He bit his teeth together.</p>

<p><i>You never catch up with the war.</i></p>

<p>You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped
trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the
dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of
its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see
it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your
ribs.</p>

<p>You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by
grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over
feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space
suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred
billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you
extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.</p>

<p>That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering
silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up
all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.</p>

<p>You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be.
After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing
your job with mechanical hands.</p>

<p>But even a machine breaks down....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Sam!" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder.
Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy
official. "Take a look at this!"</p>

<p>Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong
with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it
was.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because the body looked a little <i>too</i> dead.</p>

<p>Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way,
stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as
delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly
blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed
close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a
cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed
completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.</p>

<p>Burnett rubbed his jaw. "Well?"</p>

<p>Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and
black. "Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?"</p>

<p>Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.</p>

<p>"It's Lethla!" Rice retorted.</p>

<p>Burnett said, "Lethla?" And then: "Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That
right?"</p>

<p>"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in
space, then Kriere's not far away from him!"</p>

<p>Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell.
What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone
else.</p>

<p>Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. "Snap out of it, Sam. Think!
Kriere&mdash;The All-Mighty&mdash;in our territory. His right hand man dead. That
means Kriere was in an accident, too!"</p>

<p>Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.
"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the
Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the
day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick
of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling
through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good
green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.</p>

<p>"As for Kriere&mdash;if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution
is taken to protect that one."</p>

<p>"But Lethla! His body must mean something!"</p>

<p>"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a
battle-cuiser to go against him?"</p>

<p>"We'll radio for help?"</p>

<p>"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred
thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has
swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice."</p>

<p>Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw
hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His
fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,
"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!"</p>

<p>Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's
barrel-chest. "Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and
days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads
bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who
start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes.
He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship,
hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own
heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.</p>

<p>"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't
care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here&mdash;what's his name?
Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine
beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!"</p>

<p>Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.</p>

<p>Lethla was alive.</p>

<p>He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream.
He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the
necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what
language it would use if it had to.</p>

<p>Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he
knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a
pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it
like a dead cold star.</p>

<p>Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From
the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight,
biting lines into his sharp face.</p>

<p>Rice got it out, finally. "How'd you do it?" he demanded, bitterly.
"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!"</p>

<p>A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. <i>You
never catch up with the war!</i></p>

<p>But what if the war catches up with you?</p>

<p>What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the
chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick
fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the
halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off
of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been
inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.</p>

<p>He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. "That's how I did it,
Earthman."</p>

<p>"Glassite!" said Rice. "A face-moulded mask of glassite!"</p>

<p>Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. "Very marvelously pared to
an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the
head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed
as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible
at all."</p>

<p>Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and
the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and
quick.</p>

<p>Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. "First time in years a man ever came
aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change."</p>

<p>Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. "I thought it might be. Where's
your radio?"</p>

<p>"Go find it!" snapped Rice, hotly.</p>

<p>"I will." One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.
"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock
is safe. Don't move." Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the
ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and
coils. The radio.</p>

<p>Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his
feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by
the new bitterness in it.</p>

<p>Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.</p>

<p>He smiled. "That's better. Now. We can talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rice said it, slow:</p>

<p>"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead
men belong here."</p>

<p>Lethla's gun grip tightened. "More talk of that nature, and only dead
men there will be." He blinked. "But first&mdash;we must rescue Kriere...."</p>

<p>"Kriere!" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.</p>

<p>Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes
lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama.
Lethla's voice came next:</p>

<p>"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus
at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these
air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked
unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the
life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing
their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the
Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.</p>

<p>"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus.
We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture
was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a
small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our
chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to
trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too
late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for
brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later."</p>

<p>Rice's voice was sullen. "A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the
protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe
to Venus."</p>

<p>Lethla bowed slightly. "Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing
safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?"</p>

<p>"Precious is the word for you, brother!" said Rice.</p>

<p>"Enough!" Lethla moved his gun several inches.</p>

<p>"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be
picked up&mdash;<i>now!</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time
in years. "Sure," said Sam, smiling. "We'll pick him up."</p>

<p>"No tricks," said Lethla.</p>

<p>Burnett scowled and smiled together. "No tricks. You'll have Kriere on
board the <i>Constellation</i> in half an hour or I'm no coroner."</p>

<p>"Follow me up the ladder."</p>

<p>Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. "Come on."</p>

<p>Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor.
Rice grumbled and cursed after him.</p>

<p>On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like
a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never
knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number
ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.</p>

<p>There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And
what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he
chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo
wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you
never knew who it would be.</p>

<p>He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over
the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that
was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals.
Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a
slow pace.</p>

<p>Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape?
See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be
hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out
alive; if they cooperated.</p>

<p>But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves
in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were
stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.</p>

<p><i>You may never catch up with the war again.</i></p>

<p>The last trip!</p>

<p>Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what
ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?</p>

<p>Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his
body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms,
wet thin lips.</p>

<p>"Now, where do you want this crate?" he asked Lethla easily.</p>

<p>Lethla exhaled softly. "Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman."</p>

<p>"Very," said Burnett.</p>

<p>He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies
being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of
hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it
would all be over.</p>

<p>Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like
fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead,
he squinted.</p>

<p>"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good
trick."</p>

<p>"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen,
eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.</p>

<p>"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up." Burnett turned to
Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last
time anybody would ever board the <i>Constellation</i> alive. His stomach
went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.</p>

<p>If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end
of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind
searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that&mdash;</p>

<p>Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like
a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat,
water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy
jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be
eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored
because of his gun.</p>

<p>Kriere would make odds impossible.</p>

<p>Something had to be done before Kriere came in.</p>

<p>Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered,
fooled&mdash;somehow. But&mdash;how?</p>

<p>Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade
where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew,
artery&mdash;heart.</p>

<p>There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and
this would be the last trip.</p>

<p>Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.</p>

<p>"Steady, Rice," he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there
was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in
the center of that silence. "Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the
star-port."</p>

<p>Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly.
Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back
kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet
sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first,
why&mdash;</p>

<p>Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of
stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the
<i>Constellation</i>. Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about
to be rescued.</p>

<p>Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he
was about to end a ten-years' war.</p>

<p>There was only <i>one</i> way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be
fast.</p>

<p>Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as
it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a
good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered
directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies
from space.</p>

<p>Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet,
too.</p>

<p>The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its
slowness.</p>

<p>It reached Kriere.</p>

<p>Burnett inhaled a deep breath.</p>

<p>The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Lethla watched.</p>

<p>He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: "You
know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the
<i>Constellation</i>. I believe it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all
around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There
was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the
head, which was carefully preserved for identification.</p>

<p>That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.</p>

<p>Burnett spun about and leaped.</p>

<p>The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.</p>

<p>Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot
ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back
like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.</p>

<p>Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and
screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the
room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and
started laughing.</p>

<p>He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever
claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.</p>

<p>Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's
young face over him. Burnett groaned.</p>

<p>Rice said, "Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam."</p>

<p>"To hell with it." Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open.
Something wet and sticky covered his chest. "I said this was my last
trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!"</p>

<p>"This is the hard way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never
have to come aboard the <i>Constellation</i>, though, Rice." His voice
trailed off. "You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll
be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his
mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of
them out:</p>

<p>"Rice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Sam?"</p>

<p>"We haven't got a full cargo, boy."</p>

<p>"Full enough for me, sir."</p>

<p>"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling
the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there&mdash;number ninety-eight is
Lethla&mdash;number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling
this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who
want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back
any way&mdash;but&mdash;the way&mdash;we used to&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen
warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and
Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a
million miles.</p>

<p>"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?"</p>

<p>Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to
dissolve.</p>

<p>Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.</p>

<p>He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing
out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed,
thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf
at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.</p>

<p>And then he said softly:</p>

<p>"<i>One hundred.</i>"</p>

<h1>Lazarus Come Forth</h1>
<p>Logan's way of laughing was bad. "There's a new body up in the
air-lock, Brandon. Climb the rungs and have a look."</p>

<p>Logan's eyes had a green shine to them, eager and intent. They were
ugly, obscene.</p>

<p>Brandon swore under his breath. This room of the Morgue Ship was
crowded with their two personalities. Besides that, there were scores
of cold shelves of bodies freezing quietly, and the insistent
vibration of the coroner tables, machinery spinning under them. And
Logan was like a little machine that never stopped talking.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone." Brandon rose up, tall and thinned by the years,
looking as old as a pocked meteor. "Just keep quiet."</p>

<p>Logan sucked his cigarette. "Scared to go upstairs? Scared it might be
your son we just picked up?"</p>

<p>Brandon reached Logan in about one stride, and while the Morgue Ship
slipped on through space, he clenched the coroner's blue uniform with
the small bones inside it and hung it up against the wall, pressing
inward until Logan couldn't breathe. Logan blew air, his eyes looked
helpless. He tried to speak and could only grunt like a stuck pig. He
waved his short arms, flapping.</p>

<p>Brandon kept him there, crucified on a fist.</p>

<p>"I told you. Let me search for my own son's body in my own way. I don't
need your tongue."</p>

<p>Logan's eyes were losing their shine, were getting blind and glazed.
Brandon stepped back, releasing the little assistant. Logan bumped
softly against metal flooring, his mouth hungry for air, his nostrils
flaring for breath. Brandon watched the little face of Logan over the
crouched, gasping body, with red color and anger shooting up into it
with every passing second.</p>

<p>"Coward!" he threw it out of himself, Logan did. "Got
yellow&mdash;neon-tubing&mdash;for your spine. Coward. Never went to war. Never
did anything for Earth against Mars."</p>

<p>Brandon said the words in slow motion. "Shut up."</p>

<p>"Why?" Logan crept back, inching up the metal hull. The blood pumps
under the skirts of the tables pulsed across the warm silence. "Does
it hurt, the truth? Your son'd be proud of you, okay. Ha!" He coughed
and spat. "He was so damn ashamed of you he went and signed up for
space combat. So he got lost from his ship during a battle." Logan
licked his lips very carefully. "So, to make up for it, you signed on a
Morgue Ship. Try to find his body. Try to make amends. I know you. You
wouldn't join the Space Warriors to fight. No guts for that. Had to
get a nice easy job on a morgue ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lines appeared in Brandon's gaunt cheeks, his eyes were closed, the
lids pale. He said, and tried to believe it himself, "Someone has to
pick up the bodies after the battle. They can't go flying on forever in
their own orbits. They deserve burial."</p>

<p>The bitterness of Logan struck even deeper. "Who are you tryin' to
convince?" He was on his feet now. "Me, it's different. I got a right
to running this ship. I was in the other war."</p>

<p>"You're a liar," Brandon retorted. "You hunted radium in the asteroids
with a mineral tug. You took this Morgue Ship job so you could go right
on hunting radium, picking up bodies on the side."</p>

<p>Logan laughed softly, but not humorously. "So what? Least I'm no
coward. I'll burn anybody gets in my way." He thought it over.
"Unless," he added, "they give me a little money."</p>

<p>Brandon turned away, feeling ill. He forced himself to climb up the
rungs toward that air-lock, where that fresh body lay, newly still-born
from space by the retrieving-claw. His palms let wet shining prints
on the rungs. His climbing feet made a soft noise in the cold metal
silence.</p>

<p>The body lay in the cold air-lock's center, as thousands had lain
before. Its posture was one of easy slumber, relaxed and not speaking
ever again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Brandon took in his breath. Numbly he realized it was not his son.
Every time a new body was found he feared and yet hoped it would be
Richard. Richard of the easy laughter and good smile and dark curly
hair. Richard who was now floating off somewhere toward some far
eternity.</p>

<p>Brandon's eyes dilated. He went to his knees and with efficient darts
of his eyes, he covered the vital points of this strange uniform with
the young body inside it. His heart pounded briefly, and when he got
up again he acted like he had been struck in the face. He walked
unsteadily to the rungs.</p>

<p>"Logan," he called down the hole in a numbed voice. "Logan, come up
here. Quick."</p>

<p>Logan climbed lazily up, emitting grunts and smoke.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Brandon, kneeling again by the body.</p>

<p>Logan looked and didn't believe it. "Where in hell'd you get that?"</p>

<p>Lying there, the face of the body was like snow framed by the
ebon-black of the hair. The eyes were blue jewels caught in the snow.
There were slender fingers reclining against the hips. But, most
important of all, was the cut of the silver metal uniform, the grey
leather belt and the bronze triangle over the silent heart with the
numerals 51 on it.</p>

<p>Logan held onto the rungs. "Three hundred years old," he whispered it.
"Three hundred years old," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes." The Numerals 51 were enough for Brandon. "After all these
centuries, and in perfect condition. Look how calm he is. Most corpse
faces aren't&mdash;pretty. Something happened, three hundred years ago, and
he's been drifting, alone, ever since. I&mdash;" Brandon caught his breath.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" snapped Logan.</p>

<p>"This man," said Brandon, wonderingly, "committed suicide."</p>

<p>"How do you figure?"</p>

<p>"There's not a mark of decompression, centrifugal force, disintegrator
or ray-burn on him. He simply <i>stepped</i> out of a ship. Why should a
Scientist of the 51 Circle commit suicide?"</p>

<p>"They had wars back there, too," said Logan. "But this is the first
time I ever seen a stiff from one of them. It can't happen. He shoulda
been messed up by meteors."</p>

<p>A strange prickling crept over Brandon. "When I was a kid, I remember
thumbing through history books, reading about those famous 51
Scientists of the Circle who were doing experimental work on Pluto back
in the year 2100. I memorized their uniforms, and this bronze badge.
I couldn't mistake it. There was a rumor that they were experimenting
with some new universal power weapon."</p>

<p>"A myth," said Logan.</p>

<p>"Who knows? Maybe. Maybe not. But before that super weapon was
completed, Earth fell beneath Mar's assault. The 51 Scientists
destroyed themselves and their Base when the Martians came.
The&mdash;myth&mdash;says that if the Martians had been only a month later&mdash;the
weapon would have been out of blueprint and into metal."</p>

<p>Brandon stopped talking and looked at the long-boned, easily slumbering
Scientist.</p>

<p>"And now he shows up. One of the original 51. I wonder what happened?
Maybe he tried to reach Earth and had to leap into space to escape the
Martians. Logan, we've got history with us, pulled in out of space,
cold and stark under our hands."</p>

<p>Logan laughed uneasily. "Yeah. Now, if we only had that weapon. Baby,
that'd be something to sing about, by God."</p>

<p>Brandon jerked.</p>

<p>Logan looked at him. "What's eating you?"</p>

<p>Brandon laid his fingers on the dead Scientist's skull.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;we <i>have</i> got the weapon," he said.</p>

<p>His hand trembled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The coroner pumps throbbed warmly under the table, while manipulating
tendrils darted swiftly, effectively over the dead Scientist's body.
Brandon moved, too, like a machine. In a regular fury he had forced
Logan to hurry the body down into the preparations room, inject
adrenalin, thermal units, apply the blood pump and accomplish a
thousand other demanding and instantaneous tasks.</p>

<p>"Now, out of the way, Logan. You're more trouble than help!"</p>

<p>Logan stumbled back. "Okay, okay. Don't get snotty. It won't work. I
keep telling you. All these years."</p>

<p>Brandon could see nothing. Logan's voice was muffled, far away. There
was only the surge of pumps, the sweating heat of the little cubicle,
and niche number 12 waiting to receive this body if he failed. Brandon
swallowed, tightly. Niche number 12 waiting, cold, ready, waiting for a
body to fill it. He'd have to fight to keep it empty.</p>

<p>He began to sing-song words over and over as he injected stimulants
into the body. He didn't know where the words came from, from
childhood, maybe, from his old religious memories:</p>

<p>"Lazarus come forth," Brandon said softly, bending close, adjusting the
manipulatory tendrils. "Lazarus, come forth."</p>

<p>Logan snorted. "Lazarus! Will you can that!"</p>

<p>Brandon had to talk to himself. "Inside his brain he's got that energy
weapon that Earth can use to end the war. It's been frozen in there
three hundred years. If we can thaw it out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who ever heard of reviving a body after that long?"</p>

<p>"He's perfectly preserved. Perfectly frozen. Oh, God, this is Fate. I
know it. I feel it. Came to find Richard and I found something bigger!
Lazarus! Lazarus, come forth from the tomb!"</p>

<p>The machines thrummed louder, beating into his ears. Brandon listened,
watched for just one pulse, just one beat, one word, one moment of life.</p>

<p>"Air for the lungs," and Brandon attached oxygen cones over the fine
nose and relaxed lips. "Pressure on the ribs." Metal plates pressuring
the rib case slowly out and in. "Circulation." Brandon touched the
control at the foot of the table and the whole table tilted back and
forth in a whining teeter-tauter.</p>

<p>A report clipped through on the audio:</p>

<p>"Morgue Ship. Battle Unit 766 calling Morgue Ship. Off orbit of Pluto
234CC, point zero-two, off 32, one by seven, follow up. Battle just
terminated. Six Martian ships destroyed. One Earth ship blasted apart
and bodies thrown into space. Please recover. 79 men. Bodies in orbit
heading toward sun at 23456 an hour. Check."</p>

<p>Logan flipped his cigarette away. "That's us. We got work to do. Come
on. Let that stiff cool. He'll be here when we come back."</p>

<p>"No!" Brandon fairly shouted it, eyes wild. "He's more important than
all those men out there. We can help them later. He can help us now!"</p>

<p>The table came to a halt, bringing absolute silence.</p>

<p>Brandon bent forward to press his ear against the warmed rib-casing.</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>There it was. Unbelievably, there it was. A tiny pulse stirring like
a termite down under, softly and sluggishly moving through the body,
jabbing the heart and&mdash;NOW! Brandon cried out. He was shaking all over.
He was setting the machine in operation again, and talking and laughing
and going crazy with it.</p>

<p>"He's alive! He's alive! Lazarus has come from the tomb! Lazarus
reborn again! Notify Earth immediately!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the end of an hour, the pulse was timing normal, the temperature was
lowering down from a fever, and Brandon moved about the preparations'
room watching every quiver of the body's internal organs through the
tubular-fluoroscope.</p>

<p>He exulted. This was having Richard alive again. It was compensation.
You roared into space looking somewhere for your lost self-respect,
your pride, looking for your son who is shooting on some soundless
orbit into nothing, and now the biggest child of Fate is deposited in
your arms to warm and bring to life. It was impossible. It was good.
Brandon almost laughed. He almost forgot he had ever known fear of
death. This was conquering it. This was like bringing Richard back to
life, but even more. It meant things to earth and humanity; things
about weapons and power and peace.</p>

<p>Logan interrupted Brandon's exultant thinking by blowing smoke in
his face. "You know something, Brandy? This is damn good! You done
something, Mister. Yeah."</p>

<p>"I thought I told you to notify Earth."</p>

<p>"Ah, I been watching you. Like a mama hen and her chick. I been
thinking, too. Yeah." Logan shook ashes off his smoke. "Ever since you
pulled in this prize fish, I been turning it over in my mind."</p>

<p>"Go up to the radio room and call Earth. We've got to rush the
Scientist to Moon Base immediately. We can talk later."</p>

<p>There was that hard green shine to Logan's narrow eyes again. He poked
a finger at Brandon. "Here's the way I get it. Do we get rewarded for
finding this guy? Hell, no. It's our routine work. We're <i>supposed</i> to
pick up bodies. Here we got a guy who's the key to the whole damn war."</p>

<p>Brandon's lips hardly moved. "Call Earth."</p>

<p>"Now, hold on a moment, Brandy. Let me finish this. I been thinking,
maybe the Martians'd like to own him, too. Maybe they'd like to be
around when he starts talking."</p>

<p>Brandon made a fist. "You heard what I said."</p>

<p>Logan put his hand behind him. "I just want to talk peaceable with you,
Brandy. I don't want trouble. But all we'll get for finding this stiff
is a kiss on the cheek and a medal on the chest. Hell!"</p>

<p>Brandon was going to hit him hard, before he saw the gun in Logan's
fingers, whipped out and pointing.</p>

<p>"Take a look at this, Brandy, and don't lose your supper."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Brandon quailed. It was almost an involuntary
action. His whole body plunged back, aching, pulling with it.</p>

<p>"Now, let's march up to the radio room. I got a little calling to do.
Get on with you. Hup!"</p>

<p>In the radio-room, Logan touched studs, raised a mike to his lips and
said:</p>

<p>"Beam to Mars. Beam to Mars. Morgue Ship of Earth calling. Mars Beam
answer."</p>

<p>After an interval, Mars gave answer. Logan said:</p>

<p>"I've just picked up the body of a 51 Circle Scientist. He's been
resuscitated. Give me your fleet commander. I got things to talk over
with him." Logan smiled. "Oh, <i>hello</i>, commander!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later, the discussions were over, the plans made. Logan
hung up, satisfied. Brandon looked at him as if he couldn't believe he
was serious.</p>

<p>Back down in the control room, Logan set a course, and then forced
Brandon to get the body ready. He bragged about the deal. "A half ton
of radium, Brandy. Not bad, eh? Good pay. More than Earth'd ever give
me for my routine duty."</p>

<p>Brandon shuddered. "You fool. The Martians will kill us."</p>

<p>"Uh-uh." Logan pantomimed him into moving the body onto a rollered
table and taking it to the emergency life-craft air-lock. "I'm not that
dumb. I'm having you wire this emergency life-boat with explosive. We
collect the minerals first. We blow up the body if the Martians act
funny. We make them wait until we've collected our half and gotten five
hours' start toward Earth before we allow them to pick up the body.
Nice, huh?"</p>

<p>Brandon swayed over the task of wiring the life-boat with explosive.
"You're cutting your own throat. Handing over a weapon like that to
the Martian enemy."</p>

<p>It was no again from Logan. "After the Martians pick up the body and
we're safely on our way home to Earth, I press a button and the whole
damn thing blows up. They call it double-crossing."</p>

<p>"Destroy the body?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes. Think I want a weapon like that turned over to the enemy?
Guh!"</p>

<p>"The war'll go on for years."</p>

<p>"So Earth'll wind up winning, anyhow. We're getting along, slow but
sure. And when the war's over, I got a load of radium to set myself up
in business and a big future in front of me."</p>

<p>"So you kill millions of men, for that."</p>

<p>"What'd they do for me? Ruined my guts in the last war!"</p>

<p>There had to be some argument, something to say, quick, something to
do to a man like Logan. Brandon thought, quickly. "Look, Logan, we can
work this, but save the body."</p>

<p>"Don't be funny."</p>

<p>"Put one of the <i>other</i> bodies in the ship we send out. Save Lazarus'
body and run back to Earth with it!" insisted Brandon.</p>

<p>The little assistant shook his head. "The Martians'll have an
intra-material beam focused on the emergency ship when they get within
one hundred thousand miles of her. They'll be able to tell then if the
body's dead or alive. No dice, Brandy."</p>

<p>It was hardly like leaping himself, thought Brandon. It was just
frustration and rage and unthinking action. Brandon jumped. Logan
hardly flicked an eyelid as he pressed the trigger of his paragun. It
paralyzed the legs from under Brandon and he collapsed. The gun sprayed
over his groin and chest and face, too, in a withering shower of
red-hot needles. The lights went out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a loose sensation of empty space, and acceleration minus
power. Pure soundless momentum. Brandon forced his eyes open painfully,
and found himself alone in the preparations' room, lying stretched upon
one of the coroner tables, bound with metal fibre.</p>

<p>"Logan!" he bellowed it up through the ship. He waited. He did it
again. "Logan!"</p>

<p>He fought the metal fibre, knotting his fists, twisting his arms. He
yanked himself back and forth. It pretty well held, except for a
looseness in the right hand binding. He worked on that. Upstairs, a
queer, detached Martian bass voice intoned itself.</p>

<p>"500,000 miles. Prepare your emergency craft with the body of the
Scientist inside of it, Morgue Ship. At 300,000 miles, release the
emergency craft. We'll release <i>our</i> mineral payment ship now, giving
you a half hour leeway to pick it up. It contains the exact amount you
asked for."</p>

<p>Logan's voice next:</p>

<p>"Good. The Scientist is alive, still, and doing well. You're getting a
bargain."</p>

<p>Brandon's face whitened, bringing out all the hard, scared bones of
it, the cheeks and brow and chin bones. He jerked against the binding
and it only jumped the air from his lungs so he sobbed. Breathing
deeply, he lay back. They were taking his child back out into space.
Lazarus, his second son, whom he had birthed out of space with a metal
retriever, they were taking back out and away from him. You can't
have your real son; so you take the second best and you slap him into
breathing life, into breathing consciousness, and before he is a day
old they try to tear him away from you again. Brandon fairly yelled
against his manacles of wire. Sweat came down his face, and the stuff
from his eyes wasn't all sweat.</p>

<p>Logan tiptoed down the hard rungs, grinning.</p>

<p>"Awake, Sleeping Beauty?"</p>

<p>Brandon said nothing. His right hand was loosened. It was wet and
loosened, working like a small white animal at his side, slipping from
its wire trap.</p>

<p>"You can't go ahead with it, Logan."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The Earth Tribunal will find out."</p>

<p>"You won't tell them." Logan was doing something across the room.
He was the only moving thing in front of a hundred cold shelves of
sleeping warriors.</p>

<p>Brandon gasped, tried to get up, fell back. "How'll you fake my death?"</p>

<p>"With an injection of sulfacardium. Heart failure. Too much pulse on a
too old heart. Simple." Logan turned and there was a hypodermic in his
hand.</p>

<p>Brandon lay there. The ship went on and on. The body was upstairs,
lying breathing in its metal cradle, mothered by him and jerked to
life by him, and now going away. Brandon managed to say:</p>

<p>"Do me a favor?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Give me the drug now. I don't want to be awake when you send Lazarus
out. I don't want that."</p>

<p>"Sure." Logan came walking across the deck, raising the hypodermic. It
glittered hard and silver fine, and sharp.</p>

<p>"One more thing, Logan."</p>

<p>"Hurry it up!"</p>

<p>Only one arm free, one leg able to move slightly. Logan was pressing
against the table, now. The hypodermic hesitated in his fingers.</p>

<p>"This!" said Brandon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With one foot, Brandon kicked the teeter-tauter control at the base
of the board. The board, whining, began to elevate swiftly. With his
free arm, instantly pulling the last way free from the wire, Brandon
clutched Logan's screaming head and jammed it down under the table,
under the descending board. Board and metal base ground together and
kept on going three inches. Logan screamed only once. The sounds after
that were so horrible that Brandon retched. Logan's body slumped and
hung, arms slack, hypo dropped and shattered on the deck.</p>

<p>The whole table kept going up and down, up and down.</p>

<p>It made Brandon sicker with each movement. The whole room revolved,
tipped, spun sickishly. The corpses in all their niches seemed to
shiver with it.</p>

<p>He managed to kick the control to neutral and the table poised,
elevated at the heels, so blood pounded hotly into Brandon's pale
face, lighting, coloring it. His heart was pounding furiously and the
chronometer upon the hull-wall clicked out time passing, time passing
and miles with it, and Martians coming so much the closer....</p>

<p>He fought the remaining wires continuously, cursing, bringing threads
and beads of blood from raw wrist, ankle and hips. Red lights buzzed
like insects on the ceiling, spelling out:</p>

<p>"ROCKET COMING ... UNKNOWN CRAFT ... ROCKET APPROACHING...."</p>

<p>Hold on, Lazarus. Don't let them wake you all the way up. Don't let
them take you. Better for you to go on slumbering forever.</p>

<p>The wire on his left wrist sprang open. It took another five minutes to
bleed himself out of the ankle wires. The ship spun on, all too quickly.</p>

<p>Not looking at Logan's body, Brandon sprang from the table and with
an infinite weariness tried to speed himself up the rungs. His mind
raced ahead, but his body could only sludge rung after rung upward into
the radio room. The door to the emergency rocket boat was wide and
inside, living quietly, cheeks pink, pulse beating softly in throat,
Lazarus lay unthinking, unknowing that his new father had come into his
presence.</p>

<p>Brandon glanced at his wrist chronometer. Almost time to slam that
door, shoving Lazarus out into space to meet the Martians. Five minutes.</p>

<p>He stood there, sweating. Then, decided, he put a tight audio beam
straight on through to green Earth. Earth.</p>

<p>"<i>Morgue Ship coming home. Morgue Ship coming home! Important cargo.
Important cargo. Please meet us off the Moon!</i>"</p>

<p>Setting the ship controls into an automatic mesh, he felt the
thundering jets explode to life under him. It was not alone their
shaking that pulsed through his body. It was something of himself, too.
He was sick. He wanted to get back to Earth so badly he was violently
ill with the desire. To forget all of war and death.</p>

<p>He could give Lazarus to the enemy and then turn homeward. Yes, he
supposed he could do that. But, give up a second son where you already
have given up one? No. No. Or, destroy the body now? Brandon fingered
a ray-gun momentarily. Then he threw it away from him, eyes closed,
swaying. No.</p>

<p>And if he should try to run away to Earth now? The Martians would
pursue and capture him. There was no speed in a Morgue Ship to
outdistance superior craft.</p>

<p>Brandon walked unsteadily to the side of the sleeping Scientist. He
watched him a moment, touching him, looking at him with a lost light in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Then, he began the final preparations, lifting the Scientist, going
toward the life rocket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Martians intercepted the emergency life-rocket at 5199CVZ. The
Morgue Ship itself was nowhere visible. It had already completed its
arc and was driving back toward Earth.</p>

<p>The body of Lazarus was hurried into the hospital cubicle of the
Martian rocket. The body was laid upon a table, and immediate efforts
were made to bring it out of its centuries of rest.</p>

<p>Lazarus reclined, silver uniform belted across the middle with soft
mouse-grey leather, bronze symbol 51 over the heart.</p>

<p>Breathlessly, the Martians crowded in about the body, probing,
examining, trying, waiting. The room got very warm. The little purple
eyes blinked hot and tensed.</p>

<p>Lazarus was breathing deeply now, sighing into full aware life, Lazarus
coming from the tomb. After three hundred years of avoid death.</p>

<p>Armed guards stood on both sides of the medical table, weapons poised,
torture mechanisms ready to make Lazarus speak if he refused to tell.</p>

<p>The eyes of Lazarus fluttered open. Lazarus out of the tomb. Lazarus
seeing his companions, iris widening upon itself, forcing shape out of
mist. Seeing the curious blue skulls of anxious Martians collected in a
watching crowd about him. Lazarus living, breathing, ready to speak.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Lazarus lifted his head, curiously, parted his lips, wetted them with
his tongue, and then spoke. His first words were:</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>It was a simple sentence, and all of the Martians bent forward to catch
its significance as one of the Martians replied:</p>

<p>"23:45."</p>

<p>Lazarus nodded and closed his eyes and lay back. "Good. He's safe then,
by now. He's safe."</p>

<p>The Martians closed in, waiting for the next important words of the
waking dead.</p>

<p>Lazarus kept his eyes closed, and he trembled a little, as if, in spite
of himself, he couldn't help it.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"<i>My name is Brandon.</i>"</p>

<p>Then, Lazarus laughed....</p>

<h1>DEFENSE MECH</h1>
<p>Oh, my god, do you realize how far from Earth we are? Do you really
<i>think</i> about it? It's enough to scare the guts from a man. Hold me up.
<i>Do</i> something. Give me sedatives or hold my hand or run call mama. A
million cold miles up. See all the flickering stars? Look at my hands
tremble. Feel my heart whirling like a hot pinwheel!</p>

<p>The captain comes toward me, a stunned expression on his small, tight
face. He takes my arm, looking into my eyes. Hello, captain. I'm sick,
if that's what you want to know. I've a right to be scared&mdash;just look
at all that space! Standing here a moment ago, I stared down at Earth
so round and cloud-covered and asleep on a mat of stars, and my brain
tore loose and screamed, man, man, how'd you get in a mess like this,
in a rocket a million miles past the moon, shooting for Mars with a
crew of fourteen others! I can hardly stand up, my knees, my hands, my
heart, are shaking apart. Hold me up, sir.</p>

<p>What are hysterics like? The captain unprongs the inter-deck audio
and speaks swiftly, scowling, into it. I hope he's phoning the
psychiatrist. I need something. Oh, dammit, dammit!</p>

<p>The psychiatrist descends the ladder in immaculate salt-white uniform
and walks toward me in a dream. Hello, doctor. You're the one for me.
Please, sir, turn this damned rocket around and fly back to New York.
I'll go crazy with all this space and distance!</p>

<p>The psychiatrist and the captain's voices murmur and blend, with here
and there an emphasis, a toss of head, a gesture:</p>

<p>"Young Halloway here's on a fear-jag, doctor. Can you help him?"</p>

<p>"I'll try. Good man, Halloway is. Imagine you'll need him and his
muscles when we land."</p>

<p>"With the crew as small as it is, every man's worth his weight in
uranium. He's <i>got</i> to be cured."</p>

<p>The psychiatrist shakes his head.</p>

<p>"Might have to squirt him full of drugs to keep him quiet the rest of
the expedition."</p>

<p>The captain explodes, saying that is impossible. Blood drums in my
head. The doctor moves closer, smelling clean, sharp and white.</p>

<p>"Please, understand, captain, this man is definitely psychotic about
going home. His talk is almost a reversion to childhood. I can't
refuse his demands, and his fear seems too deeply based for reasoning.
However, I think I've an idea. Halloway?"</p>

<p>Yes, sir? Help me, doctor. I want to go home. I want to see popcorn
exploding into a buttered avalanche inside a glass cube, I want to
roller skate, I want to climb into the old cool wet ice-wagon and go
<i>chikk-chikk-chikk</i> on the ice with a sharp pick, I want to take long
sweating hikes in the country, see big brick buildings and bright-faced
people, fight the old gang, anything but this&mdash;<i>awful</i>!</p>

<p>The psychiatrist rubs his chin.</p>

<p>"All right, son. You can go back to Earth, now, tonight."</p>

<p>Again the captain explodes.</p>

<p>"You can't tell him <i>that</i>. We're landing on Mars <i>today</i>!"</p>

<p>The psychiatrist pats down the captain patiently.</p>

<p>"Please, captain. Well, Halloway, back to New York for you. How does it
sound?"</p>

<p>I'm not not so scared now. We're going down on the moving ladder and
here is the psychiatrist's cubicle.</p>

<p>He's pouring lights into my eyes. They revolve like stars on a disc.
Lots of strange machines around, attachments to my head, my ears.
Sleepy. Oh, so sleepy. Like under warm water. Being pushed around.
Laved. Washed. Quiet. Oh, gosh. Sleepy.</p>

<p>"&mdash;listen to me, Halloway&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sleepy. Doctor's talking. Very soft, like feathers. Soft, soft.</p>

<p>"&mdash;you're going to land on earth. No matter what they tell you, you're
landing on Earth ... no matter what happens you'll be on Earth ...
everything you see and do will be like on Earth ... remember that ...
remember that ... you won't be afraid because you'll be on Earth ...
remember that ... over and over ... you'll land on Earth in an hour ...
home ... home again ... no matter what anyone says...."</p>

<p>Oh, yes, sir, home again. Sleepy. Home again. Drifting, sleeping, oh
thank you, sir, thank you from the bottom of my drowsy, sleepy soul.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sleepy. Drifting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I'm awake!</p>

<p>Hey, everybody, come look! Here comes Earth! Right at us, like a green
moss ball off a bat! Coming at us on a curve!</p>

<p>"Check stations! Mars landing!"</p>

<p>"Get into bulgers! Test atmosphere!"</p>

<p>Get into your <i>what</i> did he say?</p>

<p>"Your baseball uniform, Halloway. Your baseball uniform."</p>

<p>Yes, sir. My baseball uniform. Where'd I put it? Over here. Head into,
legs into, feet into it. There. Ha, this is great! Pitch her in here,
old boy, old boy! <i>Smack!</i> Yow!</p>

<p>Yes, sir, it's over in that metal locker. I'll take it out. Head, arms,
legs into it&mdash;I'm dressed. Baseball uniform. Ha! This is great! Pitch
'er in here, ole boy, ole boy! <i>Smack!</i> Yow!</p>

<p>"Adjust bulger helmets, check oxygen."</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>"Put on your catcher's mask, Halloway."</p>

<p>Oh. The mask slides down over my face. Like that. The captain comes
rushing up, eyes hot green and angry.</p>

<p>"Doctor, what's this infernal nonsense?"</p>

<p>"You wanted Halloway able to do his work, didn't you, captain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what in hell've you done to him?"</p>

<p>Strange. As they talk, I hear their words flow over my head like a wave
dashed on a sea-stone, but the words drain off, leaving no imprint. As
soon as some words invade my head, something eats and digests them and
I think the words are something else entirely.</p>

<p>The psychiatrist nods at me.</p>

<p>"I couldn't change his basic desire. Given time, yes, a period of
months, I could have. But you need him <i>now</i>. So, against all the known
ethics of my profession, which say one must never lie to a patient,
I've followed along in his own thought channel. I didn't dare frustrate
him. He wanted to go home, so I <i>let</i> him. I've given him a fantasy.
I've set up a protective defense mechanism in his mind that refuses
to believe certain realities, that evaluates all things from its own
desire for security and home. His mind will automatically block any
thought or image that endangers that security."</p>

<p>The captain stares wildly.</p>

<p>"Then, then Halloway's insane!"</p>

<p>"Would you have him mad with fear, or able to work on Mars hindered by
only a slight 'tetched' condition? Coddle him and he'll do fine. Just
remember, we're landing on Earth, <i>not</i> Mars."</p>

<p>"Earth, Mars, you'll have <i>me</i> raving next!"</p>

<p>The doctor and the captain certainly talk weirdly. Who cares? Here
comes Earth! Green, expanding like a moist cabbage underfoot!</p>

<p>"Mars landing! Air-lock opened! Use bulger oxygen."</p>

<p>Here we go, gang! Last one out is a pink chimpanzee!</p>

<p>"Halloway, come back, you damn fool! You'll kill yourself!"</p>

<p>Feel the good sweet Earth! Home again! Praise the Lord! Let's dance,
sing off-key, laugh! Ha! Oh, boy!</p>

<p>In the door of the house stands the captain, his face red and wrinkled,
waving his fists.</p>

<p>"Halloway, come back! Look behind you, you fool!"</p>

<p>I whirl about and cry out, happily.</p>

<p>Shep! Shep, old dog! He comes running to meet me, long fur shining
amber in the sunshine. Barking. Shep, I haven't seen you in years. Good
old pooch. Come 'ere, Shep. Let me pet you.</p>

<p>The captain shrieks:</p>

<p>"Don't pet it! It looks like a carnivorous Martian worm. Man, the jaws
on that thing! Halloway, use your knife!"</p>

<p>Shep snarls and shows his teeth. Shep, what's wrong? That's no way to
greet me. Come on, Shep. Hey! I pull back my fingers as his swift jaws
snap. Shep circles me, swiftly. You haven't rabies, have you, Shep?
He darts in, snatches my ankle with strong, locking white teeth! Lord,
Shep, you're crazy! I can't let this go on. And you used to be such
a fine, beautiful dog. Remember all the hikes we took into the lazy
corn country, by the red barns and deep wells? Shep clenches tight my
ankle. I'll give him one more chance. Shep, <i>let go</i>! Where did this
long knife come from in my hand, like magic? Sorry to do this, Shep,
but&mdash;<i>there</i>!</p>

<p>Shep screams, thrashing, screams again. My arm pumps up and down, my
gloves are freckled with blood-flakes.</p>

<p>Don't scream, Shep. I <i>said</i> I was sorry, didn't I?</p>

<p>"Get out there, you men, and bury that beast immediately."</p>

<p>I glare at the captain. Don't talk that way about Shep.</p>

<p>The captain stares at my ankle.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Halloway. I meant, bury that 'dog,' you men. Give him full
honors. You were lucky, son, another second and those knife-teeth'd
bored through your ankle-cuff metal."</p>

<p>I don't know what he means. I'm wearing sneakers, sir.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, so you are. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, Halloway. I know how you
must feel about&mdash;Shep. He was a fine dog."</p>

<p>I think about it a moment and my eyes fill up, wet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There'll be a picnic and a hike; the captain says. Three hours now
the boys have carried luggage from the metal house. The way they
talk, this'll be some picnic. Some seem afraid, but who worries about
copperheads and water-moccasins and crawfish? Not me. No, sir. Not me.</p>

<p>Gus Bartz, sweating beside me on some apparatus, squints at me.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you, Halloway?"</p>

<p>I smile. Me? Nothing. Why?</p>

<p>"You and that act with that Martian worm."</p>

<p>What're you talking about? What worm?</p>

<p>The captain interrupts, nervously.</p>

<p>"Bartz, lay off Halloway. The doctor'll explain why. Ask him."</p>

<p>Bartz goes away, scratching his head.</p>

<p>The captain pats my shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're our strong-arm man, Halloway. You've got muscles from working
on the rocket engines. So keep alert today, eh, on your hike to look
over the territory? Keep your&mdash;b.b. gun&mdash;ready."</p>

<p>Beavers, do you think, sir?</p>

<p>The captain swallows hard and blinks.</p>

<p>"Unh&mdash;oh, beavers, yeah, beavers. Sure. Beavers! Maybe. Mountain lions
and Indians, too, I hear. Never can tell. Be careful."</p>

<p>Mountain lions and Indians in New York in this day and age? Aw, sir.</p>

<p>"Let it go. Keep alert, anyhow. Smoke?"</p>

<p>I don't smoke, sir. A strong mind in a healthy body, you know the old
rule.</p>

<p>"The old rule. Oh, <i>yes</i>. The <i>old</i> rule. Only joking. I don't want a
smoke anyway. Like hell."</p>

<p>What was that last, sir?</p>

<p>"Nothing, Halloway, carry on, carry on."</p>

<p>I help the others work, now. Are we taking the yellow street-car to the
edge of town, Gus?</p>

<p>"We're using propulsion belts, skimming low over the dead seas."</p>

<p>How's that again, Gus?</p>

<p>"I said, we're takin' the yellow street-car to the end of the line,
yeah."</p>

<p>We're ready. Everyone's packed, spreading out. We're going in groups of
four. Down Main Street past the pie factory, over the bridge, through
the tunnel, past the circus grounds and we'll rendezvous, says the
captain, at a place he points to on a queer, disjointed map.</p>

<p><i>Whoosh!</i> We're off! I forgot to pay my fare.</p>

<p>"That's okay, I paid it."</p>

<p>Thanks, captain. We're really traveling. The cypresses and the maples
flash by. <i>Kaawhoom!</i> I wouldn't admit this to anyone but you, sir, but
momentarily, there, I didn't see this street-car. Suddenly we moved in
empty space, nothing supporting us, and I didn't see any car. But <i>now</i>
I see it, sir.</p>

<p>The captain gazes at me as at a nine-day miracle.</p>

<p>"You do, eh?"</p>

<p>Yes, sir. I clutch upward. Here's the strap. I'm holding it.</p>

<p>"You look pretty funny sliding through the air with your hand up like
that, Halloway."</p>

<p>How's that, sir?</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Why are the others laughing at me, sir?</p>

<p>"Nothing, son, nothing. Just happy, that's all."</p>

<p><i>Ding Ding. Ding Ding.</i> Canal Street and Washington. <i>Ding Ding.
Whoosh.</i> This is real traveling. Funny, though, the captain and his men
keep moving, changing seats, never stay seated. It's a long street-car.
I'm way in back now. They're up front.</p>

<p>By the large brown house on the next corner stands a popcorn wagon,
yellow and red and blue. I can taste the popcorn in my mind. It's been
a long time since I've eaten some ... if I ask the captain's permission
to stop and buy a bag, he'll refuse. I'll just sneak off the car at the
next stop. I can get back on the next car and catch up with the gang
later.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How do you stop this car? My fingers fumble with my baseball outfit,
doing something I don't want to know about. The car is stopping! Why's
that. Popcorn is more important.</p>

<p>I'm off the car, walking. Here's the popcorn machine with a man behind
it, fussing with little silver metal knobs.</p>

<p>"<i>&mdash;murr&mdash;lokk&mdash;loc&mdash;cor&mdash;iz&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p><i>Tony!</i> Tony, bambino! What are you doing here?</p>

<p>"<i>Click.</i>"</p>

<p>It can't be, but it is. Tony, who died ten long years ago, when I was
a freckled kid! Alive and selling popcorn again. Oh, Tony, it's good
to see you. His black moustache's so waxed, so shining, his dark hair
like burnt oily shavings, his dark shining happy eyes, his smiling red
cheeks! He shimmers in my eyes like in a cold rain. Tony! Let me shake
your hand! Gimme a bag of popcorn, senor!</p>

<p>"<i>Click-click-click&mdash;sput-click&mdash;reeeeee-eeeeeeee&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>The captain didn't see you, Tony, you were hidden so well, only <i>I</i> saw
you. Just a moment while I search for my nickel.</p>

<p>"<i>Reeeeeee.</i>"</p>

<p>Whew, I'm dizzy. It's very hot. My heads spins like a leaf on a storm
wind. Let me hold onto your wagon, Tony, quick, I'm shivering and I've
got sharp needle head pains....</p>

<p>"<i>Reeeeeeee.</i>"</p>

<p>I'm running a temperature. I feel as if I have a torch hung flaming in
my head.</p>

<p>Hotter. Pardon me for criticizing you, Tony, but I think its your
popper turned up too high. Your face looks afraid, contorted, and your
hands move so rapidly, why? Can't you shut it off? I'm hot. Everything
melts. My knees sag.</p>

<p>Warmer still. He'd better turn that thing off, I can't take any more.
I can't find my nickel anyhow. Please, snap it off, Tony, I'm sick. My
uniform glows orange. I'll take fire!</p>

<p>Here, I'll turn it off for you, Tony.</p>

<p>You <i>hit</i> me!</p>

<p>Stop hitting me, stop clicking those knobs! It's hot, I tell you. Stop,
or I'll&mdash;</p>

<p>Tony. Where are you? Gone.</p>

<p>Where did that purple flame shoot from? That loud blast, what was it?
The flame seemed to stream from my hand, out of my scout flashlight.
Purple flame&mdash;eating!</p>

<p>I smell a sharp bitter odor.</p>

<p>Like hamburger fried overlong.</p>

<p>I feel better now. Cool as winter. But&mdash;</p>

<p>Like a fly buzzing in my ears, a voice comes, faint, far off,</p>

<p>"Halloway, damn it, Halloway, where are you?"</p>

<p>Captain! It's his voice, sizzling. I don't see you, sir!</p>

<p>"Halloway, we're on the dead sea bottom near an ancient Martian city
and&mdash;oh, never mind, dammit, if you hear me, press your boy-scout badge
and yell!"</p>

<p>I press the badge intensely, sweating. Hey, captain!</p>

<p>"Halloway! Glory. You're <i>not</i> dead. Where are you?"</p>

<p>I stopped for popcorn, sir. I can't see you. How do I hear you?</p>

<p>"It's an echo. Let it go. If you're okay, grab the next street-car."</p>

<p>That's very opportune. Because here comes a big red street-car now,
around the corner of the drug store.</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>"</p>

<p>Yes, sir, and its chock full of people. I'll climb aboard.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Hold on! Murder! What <i>kind</i> of people, dammit?"</p>

<p>It's the West Side gang. Sure. The whole bunch of tough kids.</p>

<p>"West side gang, hell, those are Martians, get the hell outa there!
Transfer to another car&mdash;take the subway! Take the elevated!"</p>

<p>Too late. The car's stopped. I'll have to get on. The conductor looks
impatient.</p>

<p>"Impatient," he says. "You'll be massacred!"</p>

<p>Oh, oh. Everybody's climbing from the street-car, looking angry at me.
Kelly and Grogan and Tompkins and the others. I guess there'll be a
fight.</p>

<p>The captain's voice stabs my ears, but I don't see him anywhere:</p>

<p>"Use your r-gun, your blaster, your blaster. Hell, use your slingshot,
or throw spitballs, or whatever the devil you imagine you got holstered
there, but <i>use</i> it! Come on, men, about face and back!"</p>

<p>I'm outnumbered. I bet they'll gang me and give me the bumps, the
bumps, the bumps. I bet they'll truss me to a maple tree, maple tree,
maple tree and tickle me. I bet they'll ink-tattoo their initials on my
forehead. Mother won't like this.</p>

<p>The captain's voice opens up louder, driving nearer:</p>

<p>"And Poppa ain't happy! Get outa there, Halloway!"</p>

<p>They're hitting me, sir! We're battling!</p>

<p>"Keep it up, Halloway!"</p>

<p>I knocked one down, sir, with an upper-cut. I'm knocking another down
now. Here goes a third! Someone's grabbed my ankle. I'll kick him!
<i>There!</i> I'm stumbling, falling! Lights in my eyes, purple ones, big
purple lightning bolts sizzling the air!</p>

<p>Three of them vanished, just like that!</p>

<p>I think they fell down a manhole.</p>

<p>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt them bad.</p>

<p>They stole my flashlight.</p>

<p>"Get it back, Halloway! We're coming. Get your flash and use it!"
That's silly.</p>

<p>"Silly," he says. "Silly. Silly."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I got my flashlight back, broken, no good. We're wrestling. There are
so many of them, I'm weak. They're climbing all over me, hitting. It's
not fair, I'm falling down, kicking, screaming!</p>

<p>"Up speed, men, full power!"</p>

<p>They're binding me up. I can't move. They're rushing me into the
street-car now. Now I won't be able to go on that hike. And I planned
on it so hard, too.</p>

<p>"<i>Here we are, Halloway! Blast 'em, men! Oh, my Lord, look at the
horrible faces on those creatures! Guh!</i>"</p>

<p>Watch out, captain! They'll get you, too, and the others! <i>Ahh!</i>
Somebody struck me on the back of my head. Darkness. Dark. Dark.</p>

<p>Rockabye baby on the tree-top ... when the wind blows....</p>

<p>"Okay, Halloway, <i>any</i> time. Just any old time you want to come to."</p>

<p>Dark. A voice talking. Dark as a whale's insides. Ouch, my head. I'm
flat on my back, I can feel rocks under me.</p>

<p>"Good morning, <i>dear</i> Mr. Halloway."</p>

<p>That you, captain, over in that dark corner?</p>

<p>"It ain't the president of the United States!"</p>

<p>Where is this cave?</p>

<p>"Suppose <i>you</i> tell us, you got us into this mess with your eternally
blasted popcorn! Why'd you get off the street-car?"</p>

<p>Did the West Side gang truss us up like this, captain?</p>

<p>"West Side gang, <i>goh</i>! Those faces, those inhuman, weird, unsavory and
horrible faces. All loose-fleshed and&mdash;gangrenous. Aliens, the whole
rotting clutch of 'em."</p>

<p>What a funny way to talk.</p>

<p>"Listen, you parboiled idiot, in about an hour we're going to be fried,
gutted, iced, killed, slaughtered, murdered, we will be, ipso facto,
dead. Your 'friends' are whipping up a little blood-letting jamboree.
Can't I shove it through your thick skull, we're on Mars, about to be
sliced and hammered by a lousy bunch of Martians!"</p>

<p>"Captain, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Berman?"</p>

<p>"The cave door is opening, sir. I think the Martians are ready to have
at us again, sir. Some sort of test or other, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Let go a me, you one-eyed monster! I'm coming, don't push!"</p>

<p>We're outside the cave. They're cutting our bonds. See, captain, they
aren't hurting us, after all. Here's the brick alley. There's Mrs.
Haight's underwear waving on the clothes-line. See all the people from
the beer hall&mdash;what're they waiting for?</p>

<p>"To see us die."</p>

<p>"Captain, what's wrong with Halloway, he's acting queer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At least he's better off than us. He can't see these creatures' faces
and bodies. It's enough to turn a man's stomach. This must be their
amphitheatre. That looks like an obstacle course. I gather from their
sign lingo that if we make it through the obstacles, we're free.
Footnote: nobody's ever gotten through alive yet. Seems they want you
to go first, Berman. Good luck, boy."</p>

<p>"So long, captain. So long, Gus. So long, Halloway."</p>

<p>Berman's running down-alley with an easy, long-muscled stride. I hear
him yelling high and clear, even though he's getting far away.</p>

<p>Here comes an automobile!</p>

<p>Berman! Ahh! It hit him! He's fallen!</p>

<p>Berman, get up, get up!</p>

<p>"Stay here, Halloway, it's not your turn yet."</p>

<p>My turn? What do you mean? Someone's gotta help Berman.</p>

<p>"Halloway, come back! Oh, man, I don't want to see this!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lift up my legs, put them down, breathe out, breathe in, swing arms,
swing legs, chew my tongue, blink my eyes, Berman, here I come, gee,
things are crazy-funny, here comes an ice-wagon trundling along,
it's coming right at <i>me</i>! I can't see to get around it, it's coming
so fast, I'll jump inside it, jump, jump, cool, ice, ice-pick,
<i>chikk-chikk-chikk</i>, I hear the captain screaming off a million hot
miles gone, <i>chikk-chikk-chikk</i> around the ice perimeter, the ice
wagon is thundering, rioting, jouncing, shaking, rolling on big
rusty iron wheels, smelling of sour ammonia, bouncing on a corduroy
dirt and brick alley-road, the rear end of it seems to be snapping
shut with many ice-prongs, I feel intense pain in my left leg,
<i>chikk-chikk-chikk-chikk</i>! piece of ice, cold square, cold cube, a
shuddering and convulsing, a temblor, the wagon wheels stop rolling, I
jump down and run away from the wrecked wagon, did the wagon roll over
Berman, I hope not, a fence here, I'll jump over it, another popcorn
machine, very warm, very hot, all flame and red fire and burning metal
knobs....</p>

<p>Oops, I didn't mean to strike the popcorn man down, hello, Berman,
what're you doing in my arms, how'd you get here, did I pick you up,
and why? an obstacle race at the high-school? you're heavy, I'm tired,
dogs nipping at my heels, how far am I supposed to carry you? I hear
the captain screaming me on, for why, for why? here comes the big bad
truant officer with a club in his hand to take me back to school, he
looks mean and broad....</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>I kicked the truant officer's shins and kicked him in the face ...
Mama won't like that ... yes, mommy ... no mommy ... that's unfair ...
that's not ethical fighting ... something went squish ... hmm ... let's
forget about it, shall we?</p>

<p>Breathing hard. Here comes the gang after me, all the rough, bristly
Irishmen and scarred Norwegians and stubborn Italians ... hit, kick,
wrestle ... here comes a swift car, fast, fast! I hope I can duck, with
you, Berman ... here comes another car from the opposite way!... If I
work things right ... uh ... stop screaming, Berman!</p>

<p>The cars crashed into each other.</p>

<p>The cars still roll, tumbling, like two animals tearing at each other's
throats.</p>

<p>Not far to go now, Berman, to the end of the alley. Just ahead.
I'll sleep for forty years when this is over ... where'd I get this
flashlight in my hand? from one of those guys I knocked down? from
the popcorn man? I'll poke it in front of me ... people run away ...
maybe they don't like its light in their eyes.... The end of the alley!
There's the green valley and my house, and there's Mom and Pop waiting!
Hey, let's sing, let's dance, we're going home!</p>

<p>"Halloway, you so-and-so, you did it!"</p>

<p>Dark. Sleep. Wake up slow. Listen.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and Halloway ran down that amphitheatre nonchalant as a high-school
kid jumping hurdles. A big saffron Martian beast with a mouth so damn
big it looked like the rear end of a delivery truck, lunged forward
square at Halloway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What'd Halloway do?"</p>

<p>"Halloway jumped right inside the monster's mouth&mdash;right inside!"</p>

<p>"What happened then?"</p>

<p>"The animal looked dumbfounded. It tried to spit out. Then, to top it
all, what did Halloway do, I ask you, I ask you, what did he do? He
drew forth his boy-scout blade and went <i>chikk-chikk-chikk</i> all around
the bloody interior, pretending like he's holed up in an ice-wagon,
chipping himself off pieces of ice."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"On my honor! The monster, after taking a bit of this
<i>chikk-chikk-chikk</i> business, leaped around, cavorting, floundering,
rocking, tossing, and then, with a spout of blood, out popped Halloway,
grinning like a kid, and on he ran, dodging spears and pretending they
were pebbles, leaping a line of crouched warriors and saying they're
a picket fence. Then he lifted Berman and trotted with him until he
met a three hundred pound Martian wrestler. Halloway supposed that
it was the truant officer and promptly kicked him in the face. Then
he knocked down another guy working furiously at the buttons of a
paralysis machine which looked, to Halloway, like a popcorn wagon!
After which two gigantic black Martian leopards attacked, resembling
to him nothing more than two very bad drivers in dark automobiles.
Halloway sidestepped. The two 'cars' crashed and tore each other apart,
fighting. Halloway pumped on, shooting people with his 'flashlight'
which he retrieved from the 'popcorn' man. Pointing the flash at
people, he was amazed when they vanished and&mdash;oh, oh, Halloway's waking
up, I saw his eyelids flicker. Quiet, everyone. Halloway, you awake?"</p>

<p>Yeah. I been listening to you talk for five minutes. I still don't
understand. Nothing happened at all. How long I been asleep?</p>

<p>"Two days. Nothing happened, eh? Nothing, except you got the Martians
kow-towing, that's all, brother. Your spectacular performance impressed
people. The enemy suddenly decided that if <i>one</i> earthman could do what
you did, what would happen if a million more came?"</p>

<p>Everybody keeps on with this joking, this lying about Mars. Stop it.
Where am I?</p>

<p>"Aboard the rocket, about to take off."</p>

<p>Leave Earth? No, no, I don't want to leave Earth, good green Earth! Let
go! I'm afraid! Let go of me! Stop the ship!</p>

<p>"Halloway, <i>this</i> is Mars&mdash;we're going back <i>to</i> Earth."</p>

<p>Liars, all of you! I don't want to go to Mars, I want to stay here, on
Earth!</p>

<p>"Holy cow, here we go again. Hold him down, Gus. Hey, doctor, on the
double! Come help Halloway change his mind back, willya!"</p>

<p><i>Liars! You can't do this! Liars! Liars!</i></p>

<h1>Asleep in Armageddon</h1>
<p>You don't want death and you don't expect death. Something goes wrong,
your rocket tilts in space, a planetoid jumps up, blackness, movement,
hands over the eyes, a violent pulling back of available power in the
fore-jets, the crash....</p>

<p>The darkness. In the darkness, the senseless pain. In the pain, the
nightmare.</p>

<p>He was not unconscious.</p>

<p><i>Your name?</i> asked hidden voices. <i>Sale</i>, he replied in whirling
nausea. <i>Leonard Sale.</i> <i>Occupation</i>, cried the voices. <i>Spaceman!</i>
he cried, alone in the night. <i>Welcome</i>, said the voices. <i>Welcome,
welcome.</i> They faded.</p>

<p>He stood up in the wreckage of his ship. It lay like a folded, tattered
garment around him.</p>

<p>The sun rose and it was morning.</p>

<p>Sale pried himself out the small air-lock and stood breathing the
atmosphere. Luck. Sheer luck. The air was breathable. An instant's
checking showed him that he had two month's supply of food with him.
Fine, fine! And this&mdash;he fingered at the wreckage. Miracle of miracles!
The radio was intact.</p>

<p>He stuttered out the message on the sending key. CRASHED ON PLANETOID
787. SALE. SEND HELP. SALE. SEND HELP.</p>

<p>The reply came instantly: HELLO, SALE. THIS IS ADDAMS IN MARSPORT.
SENDING RESCUE SHIP LOGARITHM. WILL ARRIVE PLANETOID 787 IN SIX DAYS.
HANG ON.</p>

<p>Sale did a little dance.</p>

<p>It was simple as that. One crashed. One had food. One radioed for help.
Help came. <i>La!</i> He clapped his hands.</p>

<p>The sun rose and was warm. He felt no sense of mortality. Six days
would be no time at all. He would eat, he would read, he would sleep.
He glanced at his surroundings. No dangerous animals; a tolerable
oxygen supply. What more could one ask. Beans and bacon, was the
answer. The happy smell of breakfast filled the air.</p>

<p>After breakfast he smoked a cigarette slowly, deeply, blowing out. He
nodded contentedly. What a life! Not a scratch on him. Luck. Sheer luck.</p>

<p>His head nodded. Sleep, he thought.</p>

<p>Good idea. Forty winks. Plenty of time to sleep, take it easy. Six
whole long, luxurious days of idling and philosophizing. Sleep.</p>

<p>He stretched himself out, tucked his arm under his head, and shut his
eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Insanity came in to take him. The voices whispered.</p>

<p><i>Sleep, yes, sleep</i>, said the voices. <i>Ah, sleep, sleep.</i></p>

<p>He opened his eyes. The voices stopped. Everything was normal. He
shrugged. He shut his eyes casually, fitfully. He settled his long body.</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeee</i>, sang the voices, far away.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhh</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Die, die, die, die, die</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Ooooooooooooooo</i>, cried the voices.</p>

<p><i>Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm</i>, a bee ran through his brain.</p>

<p>He sat up. He shook his head. He put his hands to his ears. He blinked
at the crashed ship. Hard metal. He felt the solid rock under his
fingers. He saw the real sun warming the blue sky.</p>

<p>Let's try sleeping on our back, he thought. He adjusted himself, lying
back down. His watch ticked on his wrist. The blood burned in his veins.</p>

<p><i>Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, sang the voices.</p>

<p><i>Die, die, die, die, die. Sleep, sleep, die, sleep, die, sleep, die!
Oohhh. Ahhhhh. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</i></p>

<p>Blood tapped in his ears. The sound of the wind rising.</p>

<p><i>Mine, mine</i>, said a voice. <i>Mine, mine, he's mine!</i></p>

<p><i>No, mine, mine</i>, said another voice. <i>No, mine, mine; he's</i> mine!</p>

<p><i>No, ours, ours</i>, sang ten voices. <i>Ours, ours, he's</i> ours!</p>

<p>His fingers twitched. His jaws spasmed. His eyelids jerked.</p>

<p><i>At last, at last</i>, sang a high voice. <i>Now, now. The long time, the
waiting. Over, over</i>, sang the high voice. <i>Over, over at last!</i></p>

<p>It was like being undersea. Green songs, green visions, green time.
Bubbled voices drowning in deep liquors of sea tide. Far away choruses
chanting senseless rhymes. Leonard Sale stirred in agony.</p>

<p><i>Mine, mine</i>, cried a loud voice. <i>Mine, mine!</i> shrieked another.
<i>Ours, ours!</i> shrieked the chorus.</p>

<p>The din of metal, the crash of sword, the conflict, the battle, the
fight, the war. All of it exploding, his mind fiercely torn apart!</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeee!</i></p>

<p>He leaped up, screaming. The landscape melted and flowed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus1.jpg" alt=""/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p><i>He leaped up, raving. What was going on?</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>A voice said, "I am Tylle of Rathalar. Proud Tylle, Tylle of the Blood
Mound and the Death Drum. Tylle of Rathalar, Killer of Men!"</p>

<p>Another spoke, "I am Iorr of Wendillo, Wise Iorr, Destroyer of
Infidels!"</p>

<p>The chorus chanted. "And we the warriors, we the steel, we the
warriors, we the red blood rushing, the red blood falling, the red
blood steaming in the sun&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leonard Sale staggered under the burden. "Go away!" he cried. "Leave
me, in God's name, leave me!"</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeee</i>, shrieked the high sound of steel hot on steel.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He stood with the sweat boiling out of him. He was trembling so
violently he could not stand. Insane, he thought. Absolutely insane.
Raving insane. Insane.</p>

<p>He jerked the food kit open, did something to a chemical packet. Hot
coffee was ready in an instant. He mouthed it, spilled gushes of it
down his shirt. He shivered. He sucked in raw gulps of breath.</p>

<p>Let's be logical, he thought, sitting down heavily. The coffee seared
his tongue. No record of insanity in the family for two hundred years.
All healthy, well-balanced. No reason for insanity now. Shock? Silly.
No shock. I'm to be rescued in six days. No shock to that. No danger.
Just an ordinary planetoid. Ordinary, ordinary place. No reason for
insanity. I'm sane.</p>

<p><i>Oh?</i> cried a small metal voice within. An echo. Fading.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he cried, beating his fists together. "Sane!"</p>

<p><i>Hahahahahahahahahah.</i> Somewhere a vanishing laughter.</p>

<p>He whirled about. "Shut up, you!" he cried.</p>

<p>We didn't say anything, said the mountains. We didn't say anything,
said the sky. We didn't say anything, said the wreckage.</p>

<p>"All right then," he said, swaying. "See that you don't."</p>

<p>Everything was normal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pebbles were getting hot. The sky was big and blue. He looked at
his fingers and saw the way the sun burned on every black hair. He
looked at his boots and the dust on them. Suddenly he felt very happy
because he made a decision. I won't go to sleep, he thought. I'm having
nightmares, so why sleep. There's your solution.</p>

<p>He made a routine. From nine o'clock in the morning, which was this
minute, until twelve, he would walk around and see the planetoid. He
would write on a pad with a yellow pencil everything he saw. Then he
would sit down and open a can of oily sardines and some canned fresh
bread with good butter on it. From twelve thirty until four he would
read nine chapters of <i>War and Peace</i>. He took the book from the
wreckage, and laid it where he might find it later. There was a book of
T. S. Eliot's poetry, too. That might be nice.</p>

<p>Supper would come at five-thirty and then from six until ten he
would listen to the radio from Earth. There would be a couple of bad
comedians telling jokes and a bad singer singing some song, and the
latest news flashes, signing off at midnight with the UN anthem.</p>

<p>After that?</p>

<p>He felt sick.</p>

<p>I'll play solitaire until dawn, he thought. I'll sit up and drink hot
black coffee and play solitaire, no cheating, until sunrise.</p>

<p>Ho ho, he thought.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he asked himself.</p>

<p>"I said 'Ha ha'," he replied. "<i>Some</i> time, you'll have to sleep."</p>

<p>"I'm wide awake," he said.</p>

<p>"Liar," he retorted, enjoying the conversation.</p>

<p>"I feel fine," he said.</p>

<p>"Hypocrite," he replied.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the night, or sleep, or anything," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> funny," he said.</p>

<p>He felt bad. He wanted to sleep. And the fact that he was afraid of
sleep made him want to lie down all the more and shut his eyes and curl
up. "Comfy-cozy?" asked his ironic censor.</p>

<p>"I'll just walk and look at the rocks and the geological formations and
think how good it is to be alive," he said.</p>

<p>"Ye gods," cried his censor. "William Saroyan!"</p>

<p>You'll go on, he thought, maybe one day, maybe one night, but what
about the next night and the next, and the <i>next</i>? Can you stay awake
<i>all</i> that time, for six nights? Until the rescue ship comes? Are you
<i>that</i> good, <i>that</i> strong?</p>

<p>The answer was no.</p>

<p>What are you afraid of? I don't know. Those voices. Those sounds. But
they can't hurt you, can they?</p>

<p>They <i>might</i>. You've got to face them some time. Must I? Brace up to
it, old man. Chin up, and all that rot.</p>

<p>He sat down on the hard ground. He felt very much like crying. He felt
as if life was over and he was entering new and unknown territory. It
was such a deceiving day, with the sun warm; physically, he felt able
and well, one might fish on such a day as this, or pick flowers or kiss
a woman or anything. But in the midst of a lovely day, what did one get?</p>

<p>Death.</p>

<p>Well, hardly <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Death, he insisted.</p>

<p>He lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired of messing around.</p>

<p>All right, he thought, if you <i>are</i> death, come get me. I want to know
what all this damned nonsense is about.</p>

<p>Death came.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeee</i>, said a voice.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, said Leonard Sale, lying there. But what else?</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, said a voice.</p>

<p>I know that, also, said Leonard Sale, irritably. He turned cold. His
mouth hung open wildly.</p>

<p>"I am Tylle of Rathalar, Killer of Men!"</p>

<p>"I am Iorr of Wendillo, Destroyer of Infidels!"</p>

<p>What is this place? asked Leonard Sale, struggling against horror.</p>

<p>"Once a mighty planet!" said Tylle of Rathalar.</p>

<p>"Once a place of battles!" said Iorr of Wendillo.</p>

<p>"Now dead," said Tylle.</p>

<p>"Now silent," said Iorr.</p>

<p>"Until <i>you</i> came," said Tylle.</p>

<p>"To give us life again," said Iorr.</p>

<p>You're dead, insisted Leonard Sale, flesh writhing. You're nothing but
empty wind.</p>

<p>"We live, through you."</p>

<p>"And fight, through <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>So that's it, thought Leonard Sale. I'm to be a battleground, am I? Are
you friends?</p>

<p>"Enemies!" cried Iorr.</p>

<p>"Foul enemies!" cried Tylle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Leonard smiled a rictal smile. He felt ghastly. How long have you
waited? he demanded.</p>

<p>"How long is <i>time</i>?" Ten thousand years? "Perhaps." Ten million years?
"Perhaps."</p>

<p>What are you? Thoughts, spirits, ghosts? "All of those, and more."
Intelligences? "Precisely." How did you survive?</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</i>, sang the chorus, far away.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, sang another army, waiting to fight.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, this was fertile land, a rich planet. And there were
two nations, strong nations, led by two strong men. I, Iorr. And he,
that one who calls himself Tylle. And the planet declined and gave way
to nothingness. The peoples and the armies languished in the midst of
a great war which had lasted five thousand years. We lived long lives
and loved long loves, drank much, slept much, fought much. And when
the planet died, our bodies withered, and, only in time, and with much
science, did we survive."</p>

<p>Survive, wondered Leonard Sale. But there is nothing of you!</p>

<p>"Our <i>minds</i>, fool, our <i>minds</i>! What is a body without a mind?"</p>

<p>What is a mind without a <i>body</i>, laughed Leonard Sale. I've got you
there. Admit it, I've <i>got</i> you!</p>

<p>"True," said the cruel voice. "One is useless lacking the other. But
survival is survival even when unconscious. The minds of our nations,
through science, through wonder, survived."</p>

<p>But without senses, lacking eyes, ears, lacking touch, smell, and the
rest? "Lacking all those, yes. We were vapors, merely. For a long time.
Until today."</p>

<p>And now I am here, thought Leonard Sale. "You are here," said the
voice. "To give substance to our mentalities. To give us our needed
body."</p>

<p>I'm only one, thought Sale. "Nevertheless, you are of use."</p>

<p>I'm an individual, thought Sale. I resent your intrusion.</p>

<p>"He resents our intrusion! Did you hear him, Iorr? He resents!"</p>

<p>"As if he had a right to resent!"</p>

<p>Be careful, warned Sale. I'll blink my eyes and you'll be gone,
phantoms! I'll wake up and rub you out!</p>

<p>"But you'll have to sleep again, <i>some</i> time!" cried Iorr. "And when
you do, we'll be here, waiting, waiting, waiting. For you."</p>

<p>What do you want? "Solidity. Mass. Sensation again." You can't <i>both</i>
have it. "We'll fight that out between us."</p>

<p>A hot clamp twisted his skull. It was as if a spike had been thrust and
beaten down between the bivalvular halves of his brain.</p>

<p>Now it was terribly clear. Horribly, magnificently clear. He was their
universe. The world of his thoughts, his brain, his skull, divided into
two camps, that of Iorr, that of Tylle. They were <i>using</i> him!</p>

<p>Pennants flung up on a pink mind sky! Brass shields caught the sun.
Grey animals shifted and came rushing in bristling tides of sword and
plume and trumpet.</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!</i> The rushing.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</i> The roaring.</p>

<p><i>Nowwwwwwwwww!</i> the whirling.</p>

<p><i>Mmmmmmmmmmmmm</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ten thousand men hurtled across the small hidden stage. Ten thousand
men floated on the shellacked inner ball of his eye. Ten thousand
javelins hissed between the small bone hulls of his head. Ten thousand
jeweled guns exploded. Ten thousand voices chanted in his ears. Now
his body was riven and extended, shaken and rolled, he was screaming,
writhing, the plates of his skull threatened to burst asunder. The
gabbling, the shrilling, as, across bone plains of mind and continent
of inner marrow, through gullies of vein, down hills of artery, over
rivers of melancholy, came armies and armies, one army, two armies,
swords flashed in the sun, bearing down upon each other, fifty thousand
minds snatching, scrabbling, cutting at him, demanding, using. In a
moment, the hard collision, one army on another, the rush, the blood,
the sound, the fury, the death, the insanity!</p>

<p>Like cymbals, the armies struck!</p>

<p>He leaped up, raving. He ran across the desert. He ran and ran and did
not stop running.</p>

<p>He sat down and cried. He sobbed until his lungs ached. He cried
very hard and long. Tears ran down his cheeks and into his upraised,
trembling fingers. "God, God, help me, oh God, help me," he said.</p>

<p>All was normal again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was four o'clock in the afternoon. The rocks were baked by the sun.
He managed, after a time, to cook himself a few hot biscuits, which he
ate with strawberry jam. He wiped his stained fingers on his shirt,
blindly, trying not to think.</p>

<p>"At least I know what I'm up against," he thought. "Oh, Lord, what a
world. What an innocent looking world, and what a monster it really is.
It's good no one ever explored it before. Or <i>did</i> they?" He shook his
aching head. Pity them, who ever crashed here before, if any ever did.
Warm sun, hard rocks, not a sign of hostility. A lovely world.</p>

<p>Until you shut your eyes and relaxed your mind.</p>

<p>And the night and the voices and the insanity and the death padded in
on soft feet.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now, though," he said, proudly. "Look at that." He
displayed his hand. By a supreme effort of will, it was no longer
shaking. "I'll show you who in hell's ruler here," he announced to the
innocent sky. "<i>I am.</i>" He tapped his chest.</p>

<p>To think that <i>thought</i> could live that long! A million years, perhaps,
all these thoughts of death and disorder and conquest, lingering in the
innocent but poisonous air of the planet, waiting for a real man to
give them a channel through which they might issue again in all their
senseless virulence.</p>

<p>Now that he was feeling better, it was all silly. All I have to do,
he thought, is stay awake six nights. They won't bother me that way.
When I'm awake, I'm dominant. I'm stronger than those crazy monarchs
and their silly tribes of sword-flingers and shield-bearers and
horn-blowers. I'll stay awake.</p>

<p>But <i>can</i> you? he wondered. Six whole nights? Awake?</p>

<p>There's coffee and medicine and books and cards.</p>

<p>But I'm tired <i>now</i>, so tired, he thought. Can I hold out?</p>

<p>Well, if not. There's always the gun.</p>

<p>Where will these silly monarchs be if you put a bullet through their
stage? All the world's a stage? No. <i>You</i>, Leonard Sale, are the small
stage. And they the players. And what if you put a bullet through the
wings, tearing down scenes, destroying curtains, ruining lines! Destroy
the stage, the players, all, if they aren't careful!</p>

<p>First of all, he must radio through to Marsport, again. If there was
any way they could rush the rescue ship sooner, then maybe he could
hang on. Anyway, he must warn them what sort of planet this was, this
so innocent seeming spot of nightmare and fever vision&mdash;</p>

<p>He tapped on the radio key for a minute. His mouth tightened. The radio
was dead.</p>

<p>It had sent through the proper rescue message, received a reply, and
then extinguished itself.</p>

<p>The proper touch of irony, he thought. There was only one thing to do.
Draw a plan.</p>

<p>This he did. He got a yellow pencil and delineated his six day plan of
escape.</p>

<p>Tonight, he wrote, read six more chapters of <i>War and Peace</i>. At four
in the morning have hot black coffee. At four-fifteen take cards from
pack and play ten games of solitaire. This should take until six-thirty
when&mdash;more coffee. At seven o'clock, listen to early morning programs
from Earth, if the receiving equipment on the radio works at all. Does
it?</p>

<p>He tried the radio receiver. It was dead.</p>

<p>Well, he wrote, from seven o'clock until eight, sing all the songs you
remember, make your own entertainment. From eight until nine think
about Helen King. Remember Helen. On second thought, think about Helen
right now.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>He marked that out with his pencil.</p>

<p>The rest of the days were set down in minute detail.</p>

<p>He checked the medical kit. There were several packets of tablets that
would keep you awake. One tablet an hour every hour for six days. He
felt quite confident.</p>

<p>"Here's mud in your evil eye, Iorr, Tylle!"</p>

<p>He swallowed one of the stay-wake tablets with a scalding mouth of
black coffee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, with one thing and another it was Tolstoy or Balzac, gin-rummy,
coffee, tablets, walking, more Tolstoy, more Balzac, more gin-rummy,
more solitaire. The first day passed, as did the second and the third.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he lay quietly in the shade of a rock, counting to a
thousand by fives, then by tens, to keep his mind occupied and awake.
His eyes were so tired he had to bathe them frequently in cool water.
He couldn't read, he was bothered with splitting headaches. He was so
exhausted he couldn't move. He was numb with medicine. He resembled
a waxen dummy, stuffed with things to preserve him in a state of
horrified wakefulness. His eyes were glass, his tongue a rusted pike,
his fingers felt as if they were gloved in needles and fur.</p>

<p>He followed the hand of his watch. One second less to wait, he thought.
Two seconds, three seconds, four, five, ten, thirty seconds. A whole
minute. Now an hour less time to wait. Oh, ship, hurry on thy appointed
round!</p>

<p>He began to laugh softly.</p>

<p>What would happen if he just gave up, drifted off into sleep? Sleep,
ah, sleep; perchance to dream. All the world a stage.... What if he
gave up the unequal struggle, lapsed down?</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeee</i>, the high, shrill warning sound of battle metal.</p>

<p>He shivered. His tongue moved in his dry, burry mouth.</p>

<p>Iorr and Tylle would battle out their ancient battle.</p>

<p>Leonard Sale would become quite insane.</p>

<p>And whichever won the battle, would take this ruin of an insane man,
the shaking, laughing wild body, and wander it across the face of this
world for ten, twenty years, occupying it, striding in it, pompous,
holding court, making grand gestures, ordering heads severed, calling
on inward unseen dancing girls. Leonard Sale, what remained of him,
would be led off to some hidden cave, there to be infested with wars
and worms of wars for twenty insane years, occupied and prostituted by
old and outlandish thoughts.</p>

<p>When the rescue ship arrived it would find nothing. Sale would be
hidden somewhere by a triumphant army in his head. Hidden in some
cleft of rock, placed there like a nest for Iorr to lie upon in evil
occupation.</p>

<p>The thought of it almost broke him in half.</p>

<p>Twenty years of insanity. Twenty years of torture, doing what you don't
want to do. Twenty years of wars raging and being split apart, twenty
years of nausea and trembling.</p>

<p>His head sank down between his knees. His eyes snapped and cracked and
made soft noises. His eardrum popped tiredly.</p>

<p><i>Sleep, sleep</i>, sang soft sea voices.</p>

<p>I'll&mdash;I'll make a proposition with you, listen, thought Leonard Sale.
You, Iorr, you, too, Tylle! Iorr, you can occupy me on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays. Tylle, you can take me over on Sundays,
Tuesdays and Saturdays. Thursday is maid's night out. Okay?</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeeeee</i>, sang the sea tides, seething in his brain.</p>

<p><i>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, sang the distant voices softly, soft.</p>

<p>What'll you say, is it a <i>bargain</i>, Iorr, Tylle?</p>

<p><i>No</i>, said a voice.</p>

<p><i>No</i>, said another.</p>

<p>Greedy, both of you, greedy! complained Sale. A pox on both your houses!</p>

<p>He slept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He <i>was</i> Iorr, jeweled rings on his hands. He arose beside his rocket
and held out his fingers, commanding blind armies. He was Iorr, ancient
ruler of jeweled warriors.</p>

<p>He <i>was</i> Tylle, lover of women, killer of dogs!</p>

<p>With some hidden bit of awareness, his hand crept to the holster at his
hip. The sleeping hand withdrew the gun there. The hand lifted, the gun
pointed.</p>

<p>The armies of Tylle and Iorr gave battle.</p>

<p>The gun exploded.</p>

<p>The bullet tore across Sale's forehead, wakening him.</p>

<p>He stayed awake for another six hours, getting over his latest siege.
He knew it to be hopeless now. He washed and bandaged the wound he had
given himself. He wished he had aimed straighter and it was all over.
He watched the sky. Two more days. Two more. Come on, ship, come on. He
was heavy with sleeplessness.</p>

<p>No use. At the end of six hours he was raving badly. He took the gun
up and put it down and took it up again, put it against his head,
tightened his hand on the trigger, changed his mind, looked at the sky
again.</p>

<p>Night settled. He tried to read, threw the book away. He tore it up and
burned it, just to have something to do.</p>

<p>So tired. In another hour, he decided. If nothing happens, I'll kill
myself. This is for certain now. I'll <i>do</i> it, this time.</p>

<p>He got the gun ready and laid it on the ground next to himself.</p>

<p>He was very calm now, though tired. It would be over and done. He would
be dead.</p>

<p>He watched the minute hand of his watch. One minute, five minutes,
twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>The flame appeared on the sky.</p>

<p>It was so unbelievable he started to cry. "A rocket," he said, standing
up. "A rocket!" he cried, rubbing his eyes. He ran forward.</p>

<p>The flame brightened, grew, came down.</p>

<p>He waved frantically, running forward, leaving his gun, his supplies,
everything behind. "You <i>see</i> that, Iorr, Tylle! You savages, you
monsters, I beat you! I <i>won</i>! They're coming to rescue me now! I've
won, damn you."</p>

<p>He laughed harshly at the rocks and the sky and the backs of his hands.</p>

<p>The rocket landed. Leonard Sale stood swaying, waiting for the door to
lid open.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Iorr, goodbye, Tylle!" he shouted in triumph, grinning, eyes
hot.</p>

<p><i>Eeeeee</i>, sang a diminishing roar in time.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhh</i>, voices faded.</p>

<p>The rocket flipped wide its air-lock. Two men jumped out.</p>

<p>"Sale?" they called. "We're Ship ACDN13. Intercepted your SOS and
decided to pick you up ourselves. The Marsport ship won't get through
until day after tomorrow. We want a spot of rest ourselves. Thought
it'd be good to spend the night here, pick you up, and go on."</p>

<p>"No," said Sale, face melting with terror. "No spend night&mdash;"</p>

<p>He couldn't talk. He fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"Quick," said a voice, in the bleary vortex over him. "Give him a shot
of food liquid, another of sedative. He needs sustenance and rest."</p>

<p>"No rest!" screamed Sale.</p>

<p>"Delirious," said one man softly.</p>

<p>"No sleep!" screamed Sale.</p>

<p>"There, there," said the man gently. A needle poked into Sale's arm.</p>

<p>Sale thrashed. "No sleep, go!" he mouthed horribly. "Oh, go!"</p>

<p>"Delirious," said one man. "Shock."</p>

<p>"No <i>sedative</i>!" screamed Sale.</p>

<p>The sedative flowed into him.</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeeeee</i>, sang the ancient winds.</p>

<p><i>Ahhhhhhhhhhhh</i>, sang the ancient seas.</p>

<p>"No sedative, no sleep, please, don't, don't, <i>don't</i>!" screamed Sale,
trying to get up. "You don't&mdash;understand!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, old man, you're safe among us now, nothing to worry
about," said the rescuer above him.</p>

<p>Leonard Sale slept. The two men stood over him.</p>

<p>As they watched, Sale's features changed violently. He groaned and
cried and snarled in his sleep. His face was riven with emotion. It was
the face of a saint, a sinner, a fiend, a monster, a darkness, a light,
one, many, an army, a vacuum, all, all!</p>

<p>He writhed in his sleep.</p>

<p><i>Eeeeeeeeee!</i> the sound burst from his mouth. <i>Ahhhhhhhhhhh!</i> he
screamed.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with him?" asked one of the two rescuers.</p>

<p>"I don't know. More sedative?"</p>

<p>"More sedative. Nerves. He needs more sleep."</p>

<p>They stuck the needle in his arm. Sale writhed and spat and moaned.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he was dead.</p>

<p>He lay there, the two men over him. "What a shame," said one of them.
"Can you figure that?"</p>

<p>"Shock. Poor guy. What a pity." They covered his face. "Did you ever
see a face like that?"</p>

<p>"Totally insane."</p>

<p>"Loneliness. Shock."</p>

<p>"Yes. Lord, what an expression. I hope never to see a face like <i>that</i>
again."</p>

<p>"What a shame, waiting for us, and we arrive, and he dies anyway."</p>

<p>They glanced around. "What shall we do? Shall we spend the night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's good to be out of the ship."</p>

<p>"We'll bury him first, of course."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"And spend the night in the open, with good air, right? Good to be in
the open again. After two weeks in that damned ship."</p>

<p>"Right. I'll find a spot for him. You start supper, eh?"</p>

<p>"Done."</p>

<p>"Should be good sleeping tonight."</p>

<p>"Fine, fine."</p>

<p>They made a grave and said a word over it. They drank their evening
coffee silently. They smelled the sweet air of the planet and looked at
the lovely sky and the bright and beautiful stars.</p>

<p>"What a night," they said, lying down.</p>

<p>"Pleasant dreams," said one, rolling over.</p>

<p>And the other replied, "Pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>They slept.</p>

<h1>THE CREATURES THAT TIME FORGOT</h1>
<p>During the night, Sim was born. He lay wailing upon the cold cave
stones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He
grew, steadily.</p>

<p>Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The
nightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew
alert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,
insistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked
about, blindly.</p>

<p>There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.
And a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying
face. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was
crouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of
his face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen
night planet.</p>

<p>Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim
pebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern
entrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,
larger.</p>

<p>The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were
all that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his
withered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.</p>

<p>Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the
tunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.</p>

<p>Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their
faces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One
minute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The
next minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.</p>

<p>Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. "No, no," she soothed
him, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her
husband to rise again.</p>

<p>With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the
cave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her
grasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist
lungs!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus2.jpg" alt=""/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p><i>With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.
It was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still
in his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants
questions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,
ready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the
dying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's
new, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a
newborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It
was impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour
now. And in the next instant perhaps dead!</p>

<p>His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the
weapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their
conflicting minds. "Let me kill him!" shouted the father, breathing
harshly, sobbingly. "What has he to live for?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,
stretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.
"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than
us, and be young!"</p>

<p>The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,
eyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A
girl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to
procure food. His sister.</p>

<p>The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,
weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth
trembled and jerked. "I'll kill you!" she said, glaring down at her
husband. "Leave my children alone."</p>

<p>The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone
crib, at the little girl. "One-eighth of <i>her</i> life's over, already,"
he gasped. "And she doesn't know it. What's the use?"</p>

<p>As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,
smoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.
She was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling
the knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the
tunnel, was aging, dying.</p>

<p>Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to
meet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his
sister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.
He relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.</p>

<p>The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. "Feed the
child," he said, exhaustedly. "Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our
last day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow."</p>

<p>Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.</p>

<p>This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the
days were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The
people lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of
flame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,
and then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,
barren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset
the day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable
temperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;
all life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,
birds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal
life rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get
its living down in the brief hour of respite.</p>

<p>It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours
after birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire
life in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone
channels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep
never, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.</p>

<p><i>And he would live exactly eight days.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight
<i>short</i> days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his
mother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed
rapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.</p>

<p>Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence
was a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age
an inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.</p>

<p>Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his
father now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.</p>

<p>This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every
second of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Because in a few hours they'd be dead.</i></p>

<p>This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal
state hadn't he dreamed of <i>long</i> lives, valleys not of blasted stone
but green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then
there must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long
life? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and
depressing in eight short, vanishing days?</p>

<p>How had his people gotten into such a condition?</p>

<p>As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across
space from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing
on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.</p>

<p>When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs
from the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the
huge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon
a forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,
two hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins
thickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were
born in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this
world's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a
week, leaving children to do likewise.</p>

<p>So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for
he knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a
telepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five
thousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself
from dying eight days from now? Is there escape?</p>

<p>His eyes widened, another image came to focus.</p>

<p>Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,
unscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the
avalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship
of all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But
it was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on
the far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was
his only hope of escape.</p>

<p>His mind flexed.</p>

<p>In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful
of scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he
must go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys
and temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant
ship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or
age.</p>

<p>The cliff groaned.</p>

<p>Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.</p>

<p>"Dawn's coming," he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">II</p>

<p>Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of
the Avalanche.</p>

<p>The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with
eager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard
a rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.
Stones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for
a million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their
journey as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a
thousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.</p>

<p>Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.</p>

<p>The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to
their lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.</p>

<p>Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down
the tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There
was a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He
sensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,
bringing with her the little sister, Dark. "Wait! Be careful!" she
cried to her husband.</p>

<p>Sim felt his father crouch, listening.</p>

<p>High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.</p>

<p>"Now!" bellowed his father, and leaped out.</p>

<p>An avalanche fell down at them!</p>

<p>Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His
mother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.</p>

<p>With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The
avalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and
Dark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders
that weighed a hundred pounds each.</p>

<p>The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.
Sim's father burst out into laughter. "Made it! By the Gods! Made it
alive!" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. "Pagh!"</p>

<p>Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her
husband. "Fool! You might have killed Sim!"</p>

<p>"I may yet," retorted the father.</p>

<p>Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an
avalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from
under a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing
else to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.</p>

<p>Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.</p>

<p>The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven
was a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor
the bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining
stars.</p>

<p>This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent
temperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and
its life moved abroad.</p>

<p>Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his
people find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.</p>

<p>The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing
in the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It
flowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.
Seconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.
Father gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile
crop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at
his waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's
tongue.</p>

<p>His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge
thirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,
selfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One
thing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind
like a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for
explanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden
of food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like
a bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,
complete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew
excited with his ability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,
watching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like
scurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:</p>

<p>"Remember?"</p>

<p>Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember
when they'd lived only seven days!</p>

<p>The husband and wife looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Was it only three days ago?" said the woman, her body shaking, her
eyes closing to think. "I can't believe it. It is so unfair." She
sobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.
The wind played at her gray hair. "Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago
it was you!"</p>

<p>"An hour is half a life."</p>

<p>"Come," she took her husband's arm. "Let us look at everything, because
it will be our last looking."</p>

<p>"The sun'll be up in a few minutes," said the old man. "We must turn
back now."</p>

<p>"Just one more moment," pleaded the woman.</p>

<p>"The sun will catch us."</p>

<p>"Let it catch me then!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean that."</p>

<p>"I mean nothing, nothing at all," cried the woman.</p>

<p>The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing
wind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered
battlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those
avalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like
mantles.</p>

<p>"Dark!" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the
valley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of
green fruits, she joined them.</p>

<p>The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously
with it, and whistled.</p>

<p>The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,
bearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep
hideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child
someone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he
was not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from
the cliffs even as he was half across the valley.</p>

<p>Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like
singed snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace
blast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at
sunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.</p>

<p>Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of
the valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of
their tunnel.</p>

<p>"He'll never make it," said father. "Do not watch him, woman. It's not
a good thing to watch."</p>

<p>They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of
metal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.
Far away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space
reflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his
intra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,
lying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope
for survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he
was&mdash;strange thought&mdash;a grown man!</p>

<p>The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.</p>

<p>The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming
stopped.</p>

<p>Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,
paused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during
the night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. "We will
drink one last toast. To you, to the children."</p>

<p>"To <i>you</i>," he nodded to her. "To the children." They lifted the
icicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could
not see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were
sufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like
mercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never
penetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of
the cliff comfortably warm.</p>

<p>Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought
with mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father
seemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what
will happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.</p>

<p>Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements
of his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,
feeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was
love. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a
smell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,
the look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,
then searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her
brain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing
him, rushing him along toward oblivion.</p>

<p>He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his
cells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and
sinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at
birth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant
later, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned
in a million crevices of thought and discovery.</p>

<p>His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,
forever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no
appetite, her eyes were webbed shut.</p>

<p>"Sunset," said his father, at last.</p>

<p>The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.</p>

<p>His mother arose. "I want to see the outside world once more ... just
once more...." She stared blindly, shivering.</p>

<p>His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.</p>

<p>"I cannot rise," he whispered faintly. "I cannot."</p>

<p>"Dark!" The mother croaked, the girl came running. "Here," and Sim was
handed to the girl. "Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him." She
gave Sim one last fondling touch.</p>

<p>Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.</p>

<p>"Go now," said the mother. "Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy
yourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play."</p>

<p>Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,
looking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out
and somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.</p>

<p>"Why...?"</p>

<p>He saw his mother stiffen. "The child spoke!"</p>

<p>"Aye," said his father. "Did you hear what he said?"</p>

<p>"I heard," said the mother quietly.</p>

<p>The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,
swayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent
husband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">IV</p>

<p>The night came and passed and then started the second day.</p>

<p>The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a
funeral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,
the bodies numerous.</p>

<p>Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one
hand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.
Nobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?
Was it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get
to it and fly away into space?</p>

<p>The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground
where the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.</p>

<p>The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their
few minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet
air.</p>

<p>Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged
what they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.
They were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.</p>

<p>Another piece of his life opened wide.</p>

<p>Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock
daggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant
black, low lines of small rock cliffs.</p>

<p>"War!"</p>

<p>The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men
were running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs
where other people lived.</p>

<p>But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?</p>

<p>From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his
stomach cold. "Why, Dark, why?"</p>

<p>Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there
was the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching
Dark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,
forever hungry.</p>

<p>Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up
the rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious
red berry he had found growing under an outcrop.</p>

<p>The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then
Sim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous
jumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.</p>

<p>Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, "This should
not be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!"</p>

<p>Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. "Get on!" she cried.
"What's your name, bad one?"</p>

<p>"Chion!" laughed the boy. "Chion, Chion, Chion!"</p>

<p>Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled
features. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited
for an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood
the avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these
were things of places, of scene&mdash;mute, extravagant manifestations of
unthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,
now, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!</p>

<p>Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:</p>

<p>"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!"</p>

<p>And he vanished around a rock.</p>

<p>More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,
enemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,
quick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?</p>

<p>Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for
desired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. "Enemies are made
over things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.
Enemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've
made an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly."
And she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing
older before her rightful time. "You must fight to protect yourself.
Others, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a
ridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of
the life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You
see? As long as that is believed, you're in danger."</p>

<p>But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who
tomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain
breasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small
girl whose hair was a violet blue flame.</p>

<p>She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as
silver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a
love, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral
pyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.</p>

<p>Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he shouted after her.</p>

<p>"Lyte!" she called laughingly back.</p>

<p>"I'm Sim," he answered, confused and bewildered.</p>

<p>"Sim!" she repeated it, flashing on. "I'll remember!"</p>

<p>Dark nudged his ribs. "Here, <i>eat</i>," she said to the distracted boy.
"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her."</p>

<p>From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. "Lyte!" he mocked, dancing
malevolently along and away. "Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!"</p>

<p>Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of
hair, sadly. "I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need
weapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry&mdash;the sun's coming!"</p>

<p>They ran back to the caves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One-fourth of his life was over! Babyhood was gone. He was now a young
boy! Wild rains lashed the valley at nightfall. He watched new river
channels cut in the valley, out past the mountain of the metal seed.
He stored the knowledge for later use. Each night there was a new
river, a bed newly cut.</p>

<p>"What's beyond the valley?" wondered Sim.</p>

<p>"No one's ever been beyond it," explained Dark. "All who tried to reach
the plain were frozen to death or burnt. The only land we know's within
half an hour's run. Half an hour out and half an hour back."</p>

<p>"No one has ever reached the metal seed, then?"</p>

<p>Dark scoffed. "The Scientists, they try. Silly fools. They don't know
enough to stop. It's no use. It's too far."</p>

<p>The Scientists. The word stirred him. He had almost forgotten the
vision he had short hours after birth. His voice was eager. "Where are
the Scientists?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Dark looked away from him, "I wouldn't tell you if I knew. They'd kill
you, experimenting! I don't want you joining them! Live your life,
don't cut it in half trying to reach that silly metal thing on the
mountain."</p>

<p>"I'll find out where they are from someone else, then!"</p>

<p>"No one'll tell you! They hate the Scientists. You'll have to find them
on your own. And then what? Will you save us? Yes, save us, little
boy!" Her face was sullen; already half her life was gone, her breasts
were beginning to shape. Tomorrow she must divine how best to live
her youth, her love, and she knew no way to fully plumb the depths of
passion in so short a space.</p>

<p>"We can't sit and talk and eat," he protested. "And <i>nothing</i> else."</p>

<p>"There's always love," she retorted acidly. "It helps one forget. Gods,
yes," she spat it out. "Love!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sim ran through the tunnels, seeking. Sometimes he half imagined where
the Scientists were. But then a flood of angry thought from those
around him, when he asked the direction to the Scientists' cave, washed
over him in confusion and resentment. After all, it was the Scientists'
fault that they had been placed upon this terrible world! Sim flinched
under the bombardment of oaths and curses.</p>

<p>Quietly he took his seat in a central chamber with the children to
listen to the grown men talk. This was the time of education, the
Time of Talking. No matter how he chafed at delay, or how great his
impatience, even though life slipped fast from him and death approached
like a black meteor, he knew his mind needed knowledge. Tonight, then,
was the night of school. But he sat uneasily. Only <i>five</i> more days of
life.</p>

<p>Chion sat across from Sim, his thin-mouthed face arrogant.</p>

<p>Lyte appeared between the two. The last few hours had made her firmer
footed, gentler, taller. Her hair shone brighter. She smiled as she sat
beside Sim, ignoring Chion. And Chion became rigid at this and ceased
eating.</p>

<p>The dialogue crackled, filled the room. Swift as heart beats, one
thousand, two thousand words a minute. Sim learned, his head filled.
He did not shut his eyes, but lapsed into a kind of dreaming that was
almost intra-embryonic in lassitude and drowsy vividness. In the faint
background the words were spoken, and they wove a tapestry of knowledge
in his head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He dreamed of green meadows free of stones, all grass, round and
rolling and rushing easily toward a dawn with no taint of freezing,
merciless cold or smell of boiled rock or scorched monument. He walked
across the green meadow. Overhead the metal seeds flew by in a heaven
that was a steady, even temperature. Things were slow, slow, slow.</p>

<p>Birds lingered upon gigantic trees that took a hundred, two hundred,
five thousand days to grow. Everything remained in its place, the birds
did not flicker nervously at a hint of sun, nor did the trees suck back
frightenedly when a ray of sunlight poured over them.</p>

<p>In this dream people strolled, they rarely ran, the heart rhythm of
them was evenly languid, not jerking and insane. Their kisses were
long and lingering, not the parched mouthings and twitchings of lovers
who had eight days to live. The grass remained, and did not burn away
in torches. The dream people talked always of tomorrow and living and
not tomorrow and dying. It all seemed so familiar that when Sim felt
someone take his hand he thought it simply another part of the dream.</p>

<p>Lyte's hand lay inside his own. "Dreaming?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Things are balanced. Our minds, to even things, to balance the
unfairness of our living, go back in on ourselves, to find what there
is that is good to see."</p>

<p>He beat his hand against the stone floor again and again. "It does
not make things fair! I hate it! It reminds me that there is something
better, something I have missed! Why can't we be ignorant! Why can't we
live and die without knowing that this is an abnormal living?" And his
breath rushed harshly from his half-open, constricted mouth.</p>

<p>"There is purpose in everything," said Lyte. "This gives us purpose,
makes us work, plan, try to find a way."</p>

<p>His eyes were hot emeralds in his face. "I walked up a hill of grass,
very slowly," he said.</p>

<p>"The same hill of grass I walked an hour ago?" asked Lyte.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Close enough to it. The dream is better than the reality." He
flexed his eyes, narrowed them. "I watched people and they did not eat."</p>

<p>"Or talk?"</p>

<p>"Or talk, either. And we always are eating, always talking. Sometimes
those people in the dream sprawled with their eyes shut, not moving a
muscle."</p>

<p>As Lyte stared down into his face a terrible thing happened. He
imagined her face blackening, wrinkling, twisting into knots of
agedness. The hair blew out like snow about her ears, the eyes were
like discolored coins caught in a web of lashes. Her teeth sank away
from her lips, the delicate fingers hung like charred twigs from
her atrophied wrists. Her beauty was consumed and wasted even as he
watched, and when he seized her, in terror, he cried out, for he
imagined his own hand corroded, and he choked back a cry.</p>

<p>"Sim, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>The saliva in his mouth dried at the taste of the words.</p>

<p>"Five more days...."</p>

<p>"The Scientists."</p>

<p>Sim started. Who'd spoken? In the dim light a tall man talked. "The
Scientists crashed us on this world, and now have wasted thousands of
lives and time. It's no use. It's no use. Tolerate them but give them
none of your time. You only live once, remember."</p>

<p>Where were these hated Scientists? Now, after the Learning, the Time of
Talking, he was ready to find them. Now, at least, he knew enough to
begin his fight for freedom, for the ship!</p>

<p>"Sim, where're you going?"</p>

<p>But Sim was gone. The echo of his running feet died away down a shaft
of polished stone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seemed that half the night was wasted. He blundered into a dozen
dead ends. Many times he was attacked by the insane young men who
wanted his life energy. Their superstitious ravings echoed after him.
The gashes of their hungry fingernails covered his body.</p>

<p>He found what he looked for.</p>

<p>A half dozen men gathered in a small basalt cave deep down in the cliff
lode. On a table before them lay objects which, though unfamiliar,
struck harmonious chords in Sim.</p>

<p>The Scientists worked in sets, old men doing important work, young
men learning, asking questions; and at their feet were three small
children. They were a process. Every eight days there was an entirely
new set of scientists working on any one problem. The amount of work
done was terribly inadequate. They grew old, fell dead just when they
were beginning their creative period. The creative time of any one
individual was perhaps a matter of twelve hours out of his entire span.
Three-quarters of one's life was spent learning, a brief interval of
creative power, then senility, insanity, death.</p>

<p>The men turned as Sim entered.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me we have a recruit?" said the eldest of them.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said another, younger one. "Chase him away. He's
probably one of those war-mongers."</p>

<p>"No, no," objected the elder one, moving with little shuffles of his
bare feet toward Sim. "Come in, come in, boy." He had friendly eyes,
slow eyes, unlike those of the swift inhabitants of the upper caves.
Grey and quiet. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>Sim hesitated, lowered his head, unable to meet the quiet, gentle gaze.
"I want to live," he whispered.</p>

<p>The old man laughed quietly. He touched Sim's shoulder. "Are you a new
breed? Are you sick?" he queried of Sim, half-seriously. "Why aren't
you playing? Why aren't you readying yourself for the time of love and
marriage and children? Don't you know that tomorrow night you'll be an
adolescent? Don't you realize that if you are not careful you'll miss
all of life?" He stopped.</p>

<p>Sim moved his eyes back and forth with each query. He blinked at the
instruments on the table top. "Shouldn't I be here?" he asked, naively.</p>

<p>"Certainly," roared the old man, sternly. "But it's a miracle you are.
We've had no volunteers from the rank and file for a thousand days!
We've had to breed our own scientists, a closed unit! Count us! Six!
Six men! And three children! Are we not overwhelming?" The old man spat
upon the stone floor. "We ask for volunteers and the people shout back
at us, 'Get someone else!' or 'We have no time!' And you know why they
say that?"</p>

<p>"No." Sim flinched.</p>

<p>"Because they're selfish. They'd like to live longer, yes, but they
know that anything they do cannot possibly insure their <i>own</i> lives any
extra time. It might guarantee longer life to some future offspring of
theirs. But they won't give up their love, their brief youth, give up
one interval of sunset or sunrise!"</p>

<p>Sim leaned against the table, earnestly. "I understand."</p>

<p>"You do?" The old man stared at him blindly. He sighed and slapped the
child's thigh, gently. "Yes, of course, you do. It's too much to expect
anyone to understand, any more. You're rare."</p>

<p>The others moved in around Sim and the old man.</p>

<p>"I am Dienc. Tomorrow night Cort here will be in my place. I'll be dead
by then. And the night after that someone else will be in Cort's place,
and then you, if you work and believe&mdash;but first, I give you a chance.
Return to your playmates if you want. There is someone you love? Return
to her. Life is short. Why should you care for the unborn to come? You
have a right to youth. Go now, if you want. Because if you stay you'll
have no time for anything but working and growing old and dying at your
work. But it is good work. Well?"</p>

<p>Sim looked at the tunnel. From a distance the wind roared and blew,
the smells of cooking and the patter of naked feet sounded, and the
laughter of lovers was an increasingly good thing to hear. He shook
his head, impatiently, and his eyes were wet.</p>

<p>"I will stay," he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">VI</p>

<p>The third night and third day passed. It was the fourth night. Sim was
drawn into their living. He learned about that metal seed upon the top
of the far mountain. He heard of the original seeds&mdash;things called
"ships" that crashed and how the survivors hid and dug in the cliffs,
grew old swiftly and in their scrabbling to barely survive, forgot all
science. Knowledge of mechanical things had no chance of survival in
such a volcanic civilization. There was only NOW for each human.</p>

<p>Yesterday didn't matter, tomorrow stared them vividly in their very
faces. But somehow the radiations that had forced their aging had
also induced a kind of telepathic communication whereby philosophies
and impressions were absorbed by the new born. Racial memory, growing
instinctively, preserved memories of another time.</p>

<p>"Why don't we go to that ship on the mountain?" asked Sim.</p>

<p>"It is too far. We would need protection from the sun," explained Dienc.</p>

<p>"Have you tried to make protection?"</p>

<p>"Salves and ointments, suits of stone and bird-wing and, recently,
crude metals. None of which worked. In ten thousand more life times
perhaps we'll have made a metal in which will flow cool water to
protect us on the march to the ship. But we work so slowly, so blindly.
This morning, mature, I took up my instruments. Tomorrow, dying, I lay
them down. What can one man do in one day? If we had ten thousand men,
the problem would be solved...."</p>

<p>"I will go to the ship," said Sim.</p>

<p>"Then you will die," said the old man. A silence had fallen on the room
at Sim's words. Then the men stared at Sim. "You are a very selfish
boy."</p>

<p>"Selfish!" cried Sim, resentfully.</p>

<p>The old man patted the air. "Selfish in a way I like. You want to live
longer, you'll do anything for that. You will try for the ship. But I
tell you it is useless. Yet, if you want to, I cannot stop you. At
least you will not be like those among us who go to war for an extra
few days of life."</p>

<p>"War?" asked Sim. "How can there be war here?"</p>

<p>And a shudder ran through him. He did not understand.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow will be time enough for that," said Dienc. "Listen to me,
now."</p>

<p>The night passed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">VII</p>

<p>It was morning. Lyte came shouting and sobbing down a corridor, and ran
full into his arms. She had changed again. She was older, again, more
beautiful. She was shaking and she held to him. "Sim, they're coming
after you!"</p>

<p>Bare feet marched down the corridor, surged inward at the opening.
Chion stood grinning there, taller, too, a sharp rock in either of his
hands. "Oh, there you are, Sim!"</p>

<p>"Go away!" cried Lyte savagely whirling on him.</p>

<p>"Not until we take Sim with us," Chion assured her. Then, smiling at
Sim. "<i>If</i> that is, he is with us in the fight."</p>

<p>Dienc shuffled forward, his eye weakly fluttering, his bird-like hands
fumbling in the air. "Leave!" he shrilled angrily. "This boy is a
Scientist now. He works with us."</p>

<p>Chion ceased smiling. "There is better work to be done. We go now to
fight the people in the farthest cliffs." His eyes glittered anxiously.
"Of course, you will come with us, Sim?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Lyte clutched at his arm.</p>

<p>Sim patted her shoulder, then turned to Chion. "Why are you attacking
these people?"</p>

<p>"There are three extra days for those who go with us to fight."</p>

<p>"Three extra days! Of living?"</p>

<p>Chion nodded firmly. "If we win, we live eleven days instead of eight.
The cliffs they live in, something about the mineral in it! Think of
it, Sim, three long, good days of life. Will you join us?"</p>

<p>Dienc interrupted. "Get along without him. Sim is my pupil!"</p>

<p>Chion snorted. "Go die, old man. By sunset tonight you'll be charred
bone. Who are you to order us? We are young, we want to live longer."</p>

<p>Eleven days. The words were unbelievable to Sim. Eleven days. Now he
understood why there was war. Who wouldn't fight to have his life
lengthened by almost half its total. So many more days of youth and
love and seeing and living! Yes. Why not, indeed!</p>

<p>"Three extra days," called Dienc, stridently, "<i>if</i> you live to enjoy
them. If you're not killed in battle. <i>If. If!</i> You have never won yet.
You have always lost!"</p>

<p>"But this time," Chion declared sharply, "We'll win!"</p>

<p>Sim was bewildered. "But we are all of the same ancestors. Why don't we
all share the best cliffs?"</p>

<p>Chion laughed and adjusted a sharp stone in his hand. "Those who live
in the best cliffs think they are better than us. That is always man's
attitude when he has power. The cliffs there, besides, are smaller,
there's room for only three hundred people in them."</p>

<p>Three extra days.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," Sim said to Chion.</p>

<p>"Fine!" Chion was very glad, much too glad at the decision.</p>

<p>Dienc gasped.</p>

<p>Sim turned to Dienc and Lyte. "If I fight, and win, I will be half a
mile closer to the Ship. And I'll have three extra days in which to
strive to reach the Ship. That seems the only thing for me to do."</p>

<p>Dienc nodded, sadly. "It <i>is</i> the only thing. I believe you. Go along
now."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Sim.</p>

<p>The old man looked surprised, then he laughed as at a little joke on
himself. "That's right&mdash;I won't see you again, will I? Good-bye, then."
And they shook hands.</p>

<p>They went out, Chion, Sim, and Lyte, together, followed by the others,
all children growing swiftly into fighting men. And the light in
Chion's eyes was not a good thing to see.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lyte went with him. She chose his rocks for him and carried them. She
would not go back, no matter how he pleaded. The sun was just beyond
the horizon and they marched across the valley.</p>

<p>"Please, Lyte, go back!"</p>

<p>"And wait for Chion to return?" she said. "He plans that when you die I
will be his mate." She shook out her unbelievable blue-white curls of
hair defiantly. "But I'll be with you. If you fall, I fall."</p>

<p>Sim's face hardened. He was tall. The world had shrunk during the
night. Children packs screamed by hilarious in their food-searching and
he looked at them with alien wonder: could it be only four days ago
he'd been like these? Strange. There was a sense of many days in his
mind, as if he'd really lived a thousand days. There was a dimension
of incident and thought so thick, so multi-colored, so richly diverse
in his head that it was not to be believed so much could happen in so
short a time.</p>

<p>The fighting men ran in clusters of two or three. Sim looked ahead at
the rising line of small ebon cliffs. This, then, he said to himself,
is my fourth day. And still I am no closer to the Ship, or to anything,
not even&mdash;he heard the light tread of Lyte beside him&mdash;not even to her
who bears my weapons and picks me ripe berries.</p>

<p>One-half of his life was gone. Or a third of it&mdash;IF he won this battle.
<i>If.</i></p>

<p>He ran easily, lifting, letting fall his legs. This is the day of my
physical awareness, as I run I feed, as I feed I grow and as I grow I
turn eyes to Lyte with a kind of dizzying vertigo. And she looks upon
me with the same gentleness of thought. This is the day of our youth.
Are we wasting it? Are we losing it on a dream, a folly?</p>

<p>Distantly he heard laughter. As a child he'd questioned it. Now he
understood laughter. This particular laughter was made of climbing
high rocks and plucking the greenest blades and drinking the headiest
vintage from the morning ices and eating of the rock-fruits and tasting
of young lips in new appetite.</p>

<p>They neared the cliffs of the enemy.</p>

<p>He saw the slender erectness of Lyte. The new surprise of her white
breasts; the neck where if you touched you could time her pulse; the
fingers which cupped in your own were animate and supple and never
still; the....</p>

<p>Lyte snapped her head to one side. "Look ahead!" she cried. "See what
is to come&mdash;look only ahead."</p>

<p>He felt that they were racing by part of their lives, leaving their
youth on the pathside, without so much as a glance.</p>

<p>"I am blind with looking at stones," he said, running.</p>

<p>"Find new stones, then!"</p>

<p>"I see stones&mdash;" His voice grew gentle as the palm of her hand. The
landscape floated under him. Everything was like a fine wind, blowing
dreamily. "I see stones that make a ravine that lies in a cool shadow
where the stone-berries are thick as tears. You touch a boulder and the
berries fall in silent red avalanches, and the grass is very tender...."</p>

<p>"I do not see it!" She increased her pace, turning her head away.</p>

<p>He saw the floss upon her neck, like the small moss that grows silvery
and light on the cool side of pebbles, that stirs if you breathe the
lightest breath upon it. He looked upon himself, his hands clenched as
he heaved himself forward toward death. Already his hands were veined
and youth-swollen.</p>

<p>They were the hands of a young boy whose fingers are made for touching,
which are suddenly sensitive and with more surface, and are nervous,
and seem not a part of him because they are so big for the slender
lengths of his arms. His neck, through which the blood ached and
pumped, was building out with age, too, with tiny blue tendrils of
veins imbedded and flaring in it.</p>

<p>Lyte handed him food to eat.</p>

<p>"I am not hungry," he said.</p>

<p>"Eat, keep your mouth full," she commanded sharply. "So you will not
talk to me this way!"</p>

<p>"If I could only kiss you," he pleaded. "Just one time."</p>

<p>"After the battle there may be time."</p>

<p>"Gods!" He roared, anguished. "Who cares for battles!"</p>

<p>Ahead of them, rocks hailed down, thudding. A man fell with his skull
split wide. The war was begun.</p>

<p>Lyte passed the weapons to him. They ran without another word until
they entered the killing ground. Then he spoke, not looking at her, his
cheeks coloring. "Thank you," he said.</p>

<p>She ducked as a slung stone shot by her head. "It was not an easy
thing for me," she admitted. "Sim! Be careful!"</p>

<p>The boulders began to roll in a synthetic avalanche from the
battlements of the enemy!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only one thought was in his mind now. To kill, to lessen the life of
someone else so he could live, to gain a foothold here and live long
enough to make a stab at the ship. He ducked, he weaved, he clutched
stones and hurled them up. His left hand held a flat stone shield with
which he diverted the swiftly plummeting rocks. There was a spatting
sound everywhere. Lyte ran with him, encouraging him. Two men dropped
before him, slain, their breasts cleaved to the bone, their blood
springing out in unbelievable founts.</p>

<p>It was a useless conflict. Sim realized instantly how insane the
venture was. They could never storm the cliff. A solid wall of rocks
rained down. A dozen men dropped with shards of ebony in their brains,
a half dozen more showed drooping, broken arms. One screamed and the
upthrust white joint of his knee was exposed as the flesh was pulled
away by two successive blows of well-aimed granite. Men stumbled over
one another.</p>

<p>The muscles in his cheeks pulled tight and he began to wonder why he
had ever come. But his raised eyes, as he danced from side to side,
weaving and bobbing, sought always the cliffs. He wanted to live there
so intensely, to have his chance. He would have to stick it out. But
the heart was gone from him.</p>

<p>Lyte screamed piercingly. Sim, his heart panicking, twisted and saw
that her hand was loose at the wrist, with an ugly wound bleeding
profusely on the back of the knuckles. She clamped it under her armpit
to soothe the pain. The anger rose in him and exploded. In his fury he
raced forward, throwing his missiles with deadly accuracy. He saw a man
topple and flail down, falling from one level to another of the caves,
a victim of his shot. He must have been screaming, for his lungs were
bursting open and closed and his throat was raw, and the ground spun
madly under his racing feet.</p>

<p>The stone that clipped his head sent him reeling and plunging back.
He ate sand. The universe dissolved into purple whorls. He could not
get up. He lay and knew that this was his last day, his last time. The
battle raged around him, dimly he felt Lyte over him. Her hands cooled
his head, she tried to drag him out of range, but he lay gasping and
telling her to leave him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted a voice. The whole war seemed to give pause. "Retreat!"
commanded the voice swiftly. And as Sim watched, lying upon his side,
his comrades turned and fled back toward home.</p>

<p>"The sun is coming, our time is up!" He saw their muscled backs, their
moving, tensing, flickering legs go up and down. The dead were left
upon the field. The wounded cried for help. But there was no time for
the wounded. There was only time for swift men to run the gauntlet
home and, their lungs aching and raw with heated air, burst into their
tunnels before the sun burnt and killed them.</p>

<p>The sun!</p>

<p>Sim saw another figure racing toward him. It was Chion! Lyte was
helping Sim to his feet, whispering helpfully to him. "Can you walk?"
she asked. And he groaned and said, "I think so." "Walk then," she
said. "Walk slowly, and then faster and faster. We'll make it. Walk
slowly, start carefully. We'll make it, I know we will."</p>

<p>Sim got to his feet, stood swaying. Chion raced up, a strange
expression cutting lines in his cheeks, his eyes shining with battle.
Pushing Lyte abruptly aside he seized upon a rock and dealt Sim a
jolting blow upon his ankle that laid wide the flesh. All of this was
done quite silently.</p>

<p>Now he stood back, still not speaking, grinning like an animal from the
night mountains, his chest panting in and out, looking from the thing
he had done, to Lyte, and back. He got his breath. "He'll never make
it," he nodded at Sim. "We'll have to leave him here. Come along, Lyte."</p>

<p>Lyte, like a cat-animal, sprang upon Chion, searching for his eyes,
shrieking through her exposed, hard-pressed teeth. Her fingers stroked
great bloody furrows down Chion's arms and again, instantly, down his
neck. Chion, with an oath, sprang away from her. She hurled a rock at
him. Grunting, he let it miss him, then ran off a few yards. "Fool!"
he cried, turning to scorn her. "Come along with me. Sim will be dead
in a few minutes. Come along!"</p>

<p>Lyte turned her back on him. "I will go if you carry me."</p>

<p>Chion's face changed. His eyes lost their gleaming. "There is no time.
We would both die if I carried you."</p>

<p>Lyte looked through and beyond him. "Carry me, then, for that's how I
wish it to be."</p>

<p>Without another word, glancing fearfully at the sun, Chion fled. His
footsteps sped away and vanished from hearing. "May he fall and break
his neck," whispered Lyte, savagely glaring at his form as it skirted a
ravine. She returned to Sim. "Can you walk?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Agonies of pain shot up his leg from the wounded ankle. He nodded
ironically. "We could make it to the cave in two hours, walking. I have
an idea, Lyte. Carry me." And he smiled with the grim joke.</p>

<p>She took his arm. "Nevertheless we'll walk. Come."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "We're staying here."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"We came to seek a home here. If we walk we will die. I would rather
die here. How much time have we?"</p>

<p>Together they measured the sun. "A few minutes," she said, her voice
flat and dull. She held close to him.</p>

<p>He looked at her. Lyte, he thought. Tomorrow I would have been a man.
My body would have been strong and full and there would have been time
with you, a kissing and a touching. Damn, but what kind of life is this
where every last instant is drenched with fear and alert with death? Am
I to be denied even some bit of real life?</p>

<p>The black rocks of the cliff were paling into deep purples and browns
as the sun began to flood the world.</p>

<p>What a fool he was! He should have stayed and worked with Dienc, and
thought and dreamed, and at least one time cupped Lyte's mouth with his
own.</p>

<p>With the sinews of his neck standing out defiantly he bellowed upward
at the cliff holes.</p>

<p>"Send me down one man to do battle!"</p>

<p>Silence. His voice echoed from the cliff. The air was warm.</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Lyte, "They'll pay no attention."</p>

<p>He shouted again. "Hear me!" He stood with his weight on his good foot,
his injured left leg throbbing and pulsating with pain. He shook a
fist. "Send down a warrior who is no coward! I will not turn and run
home! I have come to fight a fair fight! Send a man who will fight for
the right to his cave! Him I will surely kill!"</p>

<p>More silence. A wave of heat passed over the land, receded.</p>

<p>"Oh, surely," mocked Sim, hands on naked hips, head back, mouth wide,
"surely there's one among you not afraid to fight a cripple!" Silence.
"No?" Silence.</p>

<p>"Then I have miscalculated you. I'm wrong. I'll stand here, then, until
the sun shucks the flesh off my bone in black scraps, and call you the
filthy names you deserve."</p>

<p>He got an answer.</p>

<p>"I do not like being called names," replied a man's voice.</p>

<p>Sim leaned forward, forgetting his crippled foot.</p>

<p>A huge man appeared in a cave mouth on the third level.</p>

<p>"Come down," urged Sim. "Come down, fat one, and kill me."</p>

<p>The man scowled seriously at his opponent a moment, then lumbered
slowly down the path, his hands empty of any weapons. Immediately every
cave above clustered with heads. An audience for this drama.</p>

<p>The man approached Sim. "We will fight by the rules, if you know them."</p>

<p>"I'll learn as we go," replied Sim.</p>

<p>This pleased the man and he looked at Sim warily, but not unkindly.
"This much I will tell you," offered the man generously. "If you die, I
will give your mate shelter and she will live, as she pleases, because
she is the wife of a good man."</p>

<p>Sim nodded swiftly. "I am ready," he said.</p>

<p>"The rules are simple. We do not touch each other, save with stones.
The stones and the sun will do either of us in. Now is the time&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">VIII</p>

<p>A tip of the sun showed on the horizon. "My name is Nhoj," said
Sim's enemy, casually fingering up a handful of pebbles and stones,
weighing them. Sim did likewise. He was hungry. He had not eaten
for many minutes. Hunger was the curse of this planet's peoples&mdash;a
perpetual demanding of empty stomachs for more, more food. His blood
flushed weakly, shot tinglingly through veins in jolting throbs of
heat and pressure, his ribcase shoved out, went in, shoved out again,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Now!" roared the three hundred watchers from the cliffs. "Now!" they
clamored, the men and women and children balanced, in turmoil on the
ledges. "Now! Begin!"</p>

<p>As if at a cue, the sun leaped high. It smote them a blow as with a
flat, sizzling stone. The two men staggered under the molten impact,
sweat broke from their naked thighs and loins, under their arms and on
their faces was a glaze like fine glass.</p>

<p>Nhoj shifted his huge weight and looked at the sun as if in no hurry to
fight. Then, silently, with no warning, he kanurcked out a pebble with
a startling trigger-flick of thumb and forefinger. It caught Sim flat
on the cheek, staggered him back, so that a rocket of unbearable pain
climbed up his crippled foot and burst into nervous explosion at the
pit of his stomach. He tasted blood from his bleeding cheek.</p>

<p>Nhoj moved serenely. Three more flickers of his magical hands and three
tiny, seemingly harmless bits of stone flew like whistling birds.
Each of them found a target, slammed it. The nerve centers of Sim's
body! One hit his stomach so that ten hours' eating almost slid up his
throat. A second got his forehead, a third his neck. He collapsed to
the boiling sand. His knee made a wrenching sound on the hard earth.
His face was colorless and his eyes, squeezed tight, were pushing tears
out from the hot, quivering lids. But even as he had fallen he had let
loose, with wild force, his handful of stones!</p>

<p>The stones purred in the air. One of them, and only one, struck Nhoj.
Upon the left eyeball. Nhoj moaned and laid his hands in the next
instant to his shattered eye.</p>

<p>Sim choked out a bitter, sighing laugh. This much triumph he had. The
eye of his opponent. It would give him ... Time. Oh, gods, he thought,
his stomach retching sickly, fighting for breath, this is a world of
time. Give me a little more, just a trifle!</p>

<p>Nhoj, one-eyed, weaving with pain, pelted the writhing body of Sim, but
his aim was off now, the stones flew to one side or if they struck at
all they were weak and spent and lifeless.</p>

<p>Sim forced himself half erect. From the corners of his eyes he
saw Lyte, waiting, staring at him, her lips breathing words of
encouragement and hope. He was bathed in sweat, as if a rain spray had
showered him down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun was now fully over the horizon. You could smell it. Stones
glinted like mirrors, the sand began to roil and bubble. Illusions
sprang up everywhere in the valley. Instead of one warrior Nhoj he was
confronted by a dozen, each in an upright position, preparing to launch
another missile. A dozen irregular warriors who shimmered in the golden
menace of day, like bronze gongs smitten, quivered in one vision!</p>

<p>Sim was breathing desperately. His nostrils flared and sucked and his
mouth drank thirstily of flame instead of oxygen. His lungs took fire
like silk torches and his body was consumed. The sweat spilled from
his pores to be instantly evaporated. He felt himself shriveling,
shriveling in on himself, he imagined himself looking like his father,
old, sunken, slight, withered! Where was the sand? Could he move? Yes.
The world wriggled under him, but now he was on his feet.</p>

<p>There would be no more fighting.</p>

<p>A murmur from the cliff told this. The sunburnt faces of the high
audience gaped and jeered and shouted encouragement to their warrior.
"Stand straight, Nhoj, save your strength now! Stand tall and
perspire!" they urged him. And Nhoj stood, swaying lightly, swaying
slowly, a pendulum in an incandescent fiery breath from the skyline.
"Don't move, Nhoj, save your heart, save your power!"</p>

<p>"The Test, The Test!" said the people on the heights. "The test of the
sun."</p>

<p>And this was the worst part of the fight. Sim squinted painfully at the
distorted illusion of cliff. He thought he saw his parents; father with
his defeated face, his green eyes burning, mother with her hair blowing
like a cloud of grey smoke in the fire wind. He must get up to them,
live for and with them!</p>

<p>Behind him, Sim heard Lyte whimper softly. There was a whisper of flesh
against sand. She had fallen. He did not dare turn. The strength of
turning would bring him thundering down in pain and darkness.</p>

<p>His knees bent. If I fall, he thought, I'll lie here and become ashes.
Where was Nhoj? Nhoj was there, a few yards from him, standing bent,
slick with perspiration, looking as if he were being hit over the spine
with great hammers of destruction.</p>

<p>"Fall, Nhoj! Fall!" screamed Sim, mentally. "Fall, fall! Fall and die
so I can take your place!"</p>

<p>But Nhoj did not fall. One by one the pebbles in his half-loose left
hand plummeted to the broiling sands and Nhoj's lips peeled back, the
saliva burned away from his lips and his eyes glazed. But he did not
fall. The will to live was strong in him. He hung as if by a wire.</p>

<p>Sim fell to one knee!</p>

<p>"Ahh!" wailed the knowing voices from the cliff. They were watching
death. Sim jerked his head up, smiling mechanically, foolishly as if
caught in the act of doing something silly. "No, no," he insisted
drowsily, and got back up again. There was so much pain he was all one
ringing numbness. A whirring, buzzing, frying sound filled the land.
High up, an avalanche came down like a curtain on a drama, making no
noise. Everything was quiet except for a steady humming. He saw fifty
images of Nhoj now, dressed in armours of sweat, eyes puffed with
torture, cheeks sunken, lips peeled back like the rind of a drying
fruit. But the wire still held him.</p>

<p>"Now," muttered Sim, sluggishly, with a thick, baked tongue between his
blazing teeth. "Now I'll fall and lie and dream." He said it with slow,
thoughtful pleasure. He planned it. He knew how it must be done. He
would do it accurately. He lifted his head to see if the audience was
watching.</p>

<p>They were gone!</p>

<p>The sun had driven them back in. All save one or two brave ones. Sim
laughed drunkenly and watched the sweat gather on his dead hands,
hesitate, drop off, plunge down toward sand and turn to steam half way
there.</p>

<p>Nhoj fell.</p>

<p>The wire was cut. Nhoj fell flat upon his stomach, a gout of blood
kicked from his mouth. His eyes rolled back into a white, senseless
insanity.</p>

<p>Nhoj fell. So did his fifty duplicate illusions.</p>

<p>All across the valley the winds sang and moaned and Sim saw a blue lake
with a blue river feeding it and low white houses near the river with
people going and coming in the houses and among the tall green trees.
Trees taller than seven men, beside the river mirage.</p>

<p>"Now," explained Sim to himself at last, "Now I can fall.
Right&mdash;into&mdash;that&mdash;lake."</p>

<p>He fell forward.</p>

<p>He was shocked when he felt the hands eagerly stop him in mid-plunge,
lift him, hurry him off, high in the hungry air, like a torch held and
waved, ablaze.</p>

<p>"How strange is death," he thought, and blackness took him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He wakened to the flow of cool water on his cheeks.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes fearfully. Lyte held his head upon her lap, her
fingers were moving food to his mouth. He was tremendously hungry
and tired, but fear squeezed both of these things away. He struggled
upward, seeing the strange cave contours overhead.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The same day as the contest. Be quiet," she said.</p>

<p>"The same day!"</p>

<p>She nodded amusedly. "You've lost nothing of your life. This is Nhoj's
cave. We are inside the black cliff. We will live three extra days.
Satisfied? Lie down."</p>

<p>"Nhoj is dead?" He fell back, panting, his heart slamming his ribs. He
relaxed slowly. "I won. Gods, I won," he breathed.</p>

<p>"Nhoj is dead. So were we, almost. They carried us in from outside only
in time."</p>

<p>He ate ravenously. "We have no time to waste. We must get strong. My
leg&mdash;" He looked at it, tested it. There was a swathe of long yellow
grasses around it and the ache had died away. Even as he watched
the terrific pulsings of his body went to work and cured away the
impurities under the bandages. It <i>has</i> to be strong by sunset, he
thought. It <i>has</i> to be.</p>

<p>He got up and limped around the cave like a captured animal. He felt
Lyte's eyes upon him. He could not meet her gaze. Finally, helplessly,
he turned.</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "You want to go on to the ship?" she asked,
softly. "Tonight? When the sun goes down?"</p>

<p>He took a breath, exhaled it. "Yes."</p>

<p>"You couldn't possibly wait until morning?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"If I lag behind, let me. There's nothing here for me."</p>

<p>They stared at each other a long while. He shrugged wearily.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, at last. "I couldn't stop you, I know that. We'll
go together."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">IX</p>

<p>They waited in the mouth of their new cave. The sun set. The stones
cooled so that one could walk on them. It was almost time for the
leaping out and the running toward the distant, glittering metal seed
that lay on the far mountain.</p>

<p>Soon would come the rains. And Sim thought back over all the times
he had watched the rains thicken into creeks, into rivers that cut
new beds each night. One night there would be a river running north,
the next a river running north-east, the third night a river running
due west. The valley was continually cut and scarred by the torrents.
Earthquakes and avalanches filled the old beds. New ones were the order
of the day. It was this idea of the river and the directions of the
river that he had turned over in his head for many hours. It might
possibly&mdash;Well, he would wait and see.</p>

<p>He noticed how living in this new cliff had slowed his pulse, slowed
everything. A mineral result, protection against the solar radiations.
Life was still swift, but not as swift as before.</p>

<p>"Now, Sim!" cried Lyte, testing the valley air.</p>

<p>They ran. Between the hot death and the cold one. Together, away from
the cliffs, out toward the distant, beckoning ship.</p>

<p>Never had they run this way in their lives. The sound of their feet
running was a hard, insistent clatter over vast oblongs of rock, down
into ravines, up the sides, and on again. They raked the air in and out
their lungs. Behind them the cliffs faded away into things they could
never turn back to now.</p>

<p>They did not eat as they ran. They had eaten to the bursting point in
the cave, to save time. Now it was only running, a lifting of legs, a
balancing of bent elbows, a convulsion of muscles, a slaking in of air
that had been fiery and was now cooling.</p>

<p>"Are they watching us?"</p>

<p>Lyte's breathless voice snatched at his ears, above the pound of his
heart.</p>

<p>Who? But he knew the answer. The cliff peoples, of course. How long had
it been since a race like this one? A thousand days? Ten thousand? How
long since someone had taken the chance and sprinted with an entire
civilization's eyes upon their backs, into gullies, across cooling
plain. Were there lovers pausing in their laughter back there, gazing
at the two tiny dots that were a man and woman running toward destiny?
Were children eating of new fruits and stopping in their play to see
the two people racing against time? Was Dienc still living, narrowing
hairy eyebrows down over fading eyes, shouting them on in a feeble,
rasping voice, shaking a twisted hand? Were there jeers? Were they
being called fools, idiots? And in the midst of the name calling, were
people praying them on, hoping they would reach the ship? Yes, under
all the cynicism and pessimism, some of them, all of them, must be
praying.</p>

<p>Sim took a quick glance at the sky, which was beginning to bruise with
the coming night. Out of nowhere clouds materialized and a light shower
trailed across a gully two hundred yards ahead of them. Lightning beat
upon distant mountains and there was a strong scent of ozone on the
disturbed air.</p>

<p>"The halfway mark," panted Sim, and he saw Lyte's face half turn,
longingly looking back at the life she was leaving. "Now's the time, if
we want to turn back, we still have time. Another minute&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thunder snarled in the mountains. An avalanche started out small and
ended up huge and monstrous in a deep fissure. Light rain dotted Lyte's
smooth white skin. In a minute her hair was glistening and soggy with
rain.</p>

<p>"Too late now," she shouted over the patting rhythm of her own naked
feet. "We've got to go ahead!"</p>

<p>And it was too late. Sim knew, judging the distances, that there was no
turning back now.</p>

<p>His leg began to pain him a little. He favored it, slowing. A wind
came up swiftly. A cold wind that bit into the skin. But it came from
the cliffs behind them, helped rather than hindered them. An omen? he
wondered. No.</p>

<p>For as the minutes went by it grew upon him how poorly he had estimated
the distance. Their time was dwindling out, but they were still an
impossible distance from the ship. He said nothing, but the impotent
anger at the slow muscles in his legs welled up into bitterly hot tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p>He knew that Lyte was thinking the same as himself. But she flew along
like a white bird, seeming hardly to touch ground. He heard her breath
go out and in her throat, like a clean, sharp knife in its sheathe.</p>

<p>Half the sky was dark. The first stars were peering through lengths of
black cloud. Lightning jiggled a path along a rim just ahead of them. A
full thunderstorm of violent rain and exploding electricity fell upon
them.</p>

<p>They slipped and skidded on moss-smooth pebbles. Lyte fell, scrambled
up again with a burning oath. Her body was scarred and dirty. The rain
washed over her.</p>

<p>The rain came down and cried on Sim. It filled his eyes and ran in
rivers down his spine and he wanted to cry with it.</p>

<p>Lyte fell and did not rise, sucking her breath, her breasts quivering.</p>

<p>He picked her up and held her. "Run, Lyte, please, run!"</p>

<p>"Leave me, Sim. Go ahead!" The rain filled her mouth. There was water
everywhere. "It's no use. Go on without me."</p>

<p>He stood there, cold and powerless, his thoughts sagging, the flame of
hope blinking out. All the world was blackness, cold falling sheathes
of water, and despair.</p>

<p>"We'll walk, then," he said. "And keep walking, and resting."</p>

<p>They walked for fifty yards, easily, slowly, like children out for a
stroll. The gully ahead of them filled with water that went sliding
away with a swift wet sound, toward the horizon.</p>

<p>Sim cried out. Tugging at Lyte he raced forward. "A new channel," he
said, pointing. "Each day the rain cuts a new channel. Here, Lyte!" He
leaned over the flood waters.</p>

<p>He dived in, taking her with him.</p>

<p>The flood swept them like bits of wood. They fought to stay upright,
the water got into their mouths, their noses. The land swept by on both
sides of them. Clutching Lyte's fingers with insane strength, Sim felt
himself hurled end over end, saw flicks of lightning on high, and a new
fierce hope was born in him. They could no longer run, well, then they
would let the water do the running for them.</p>

<p>With a speed that dashed them against rocks, split open their
shoulders, abraded their legs, the new, brief river carried them. "This
way!" Sim shouted over a salvo of thunder and steered frantically
toward the opposite side of the gully. The mountain where the ship
lay was just ahead. They must not pass it by. They fought in the
transporting liquid and were slammed against the far side. Sim leaped
up, caught at an overhanging rock, locked Lyte in his legs, and drew
himself hand over hand upward.</p>

<p>As quickly as it had come, the storm was gone. The lightning faded. The
rain ceased. The clouds melted and fell away over the sky. The wind
whispered into silence.</p>

<p>"The ship!" Lyte lay upon the ground. "The ship, Sim. This is the
mountain of the ship!"</p>

<p>Now the cold came. The killing cold.</p>

<p>They forced themselves drunkenly up the mountain. The cold slid along
their limbs, got into their arteries like a chemical and slowed them.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, with a fresh-washed sheen, lay the ship. It was a dream.
Sim could not believe that they were actually so near it. Two hundred
yards. One hundred and seventy yards. Gods, but it was cold.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

    <p><i>Ahead of them lay the ship. Sim could not believe they were so near.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The ground became covered with ice. They slipped and fell again and
again. Behind them the river was frozen into a blue-white snake of cold
solidity. A few last drops of rain from somewhere came down as hard
pellets.</p>

<p>Sim fell against the bulk of the ship. He was actually touching it.
Touching it! He heard Lyte whimpering in her constricted throat. This
was the metal, the ship. How many others had touched it in the long
days? He and Lyte had made it!</p>

<p>He touched it lovingly. Then, as cold as the air, his veins were
chilled.</p>

<p>Where was the entrance?</p>

<p>You run, you swim, you almost drown, you curse, you sweat, you work,
you reach a mountain, you go up it, you hammer on metal, you shout with
relief, you reach the ship, and then&mdash;you can't find the entrance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He fought to keep himself from breaking down. Slowly, he told himself,
but not too slowly, go around the ship. The metal slid under his
searching hands, so cold that his hands, sweating, almost froze to it.
Now, far around to the side. Lyte moved with him. The cold held them
like a fist. It began to squeeze.</p>

<p>The entrance.</p>

<p>Metal. Cold, immutable metal. A thin line of opening at the sealing
point. Throwing all caution aside, he beat at it. He felt his stomach
seething with cold. His fingers were numb, his eyes were half frozen in
their sockets. He began to beat and search and scream against the metal
door. "Open up! Open up!" He staggered.</p>

<p>The air-lock sighed. With a whispering of metal on rubber beddings, the
door swung softly sidewise and vanished back.</p>

<p>He saw Lyte run forward, clutch at her throat, and drop inside a small
shiny chamber. He shuffled after her, blankly.</p>

<p>The air-lock door sealed shut behind him.</p>

<p>He could not breathe. His heart began to slow, to stop.</p>

<p>They were trapped inside the ship now, and something was happening. He
sank down to his knees and choked for air.</p>

<p>The ship he had come to for salvation was now slowing his pulse,
darkening his brain, poisoning him. With a starved, faint kind of
expiring terror, he realized that he was dying.</p>

<p>Blackness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had a dim sense of time passing, of thinking, struggling, to make
his heart go quick, quick.... To make his eyes focus. But the fluid in
his body lagged quietly through his settling veins and he heard his
temple pulses thud, pause, thud, pause and thud again with lulling
intermissions.</p>

<p>He could not move, not a hand or leg or finger. It was an effort to
lift the tonnage of his eyelashes. He could not shift his face even, to
see Lyte lying beside him.</p>

<p>From a distance came her irregular breathing. It was like the sound a
wounded bird makes with his dry, unraveled pinions. She was so close he
could almost feel the heat of her; yet she seemed a long way removed.</p>

<p>I'm getting cold! he thought. Is this death? This slowing of blood, of
my heart, this cooling of my body, this drowsy thinking of thoughts?</p>

<p>Staring at the ship's ceiling he traced its intricate system of tubes
and machines. The knowledge, the purpose of the ship, its actions,
seeped into him. He began to understand in a kind of revealing
lassitude just what these things were his eyes rested upon. Slow. Slow.</p>

<p>There was an instrument with a gleaming white dial.</p>

<p>Its purpose?</p>

<p>He drudged away at the problem, like a man underwater.</p>

<p>People had used the dial. Touched it. People had repaired it.
Installed it. People had dreamed of it before the building, before
the installing, before the repairing and touching and using. The
dial contained memory of use and manufacture, its very shape was a
dream-memory telling Sim why and for what it had been built. Given
time, looking at anything, he could draw from it the knowledge he
desired. Some dim part of him reached out, dissected the contents of
things, analyzed them.</p>

<p>This dial measured time!</p>

<p>Millions of days of time!</p>

<p>But how could that be? Sim's eyes dilated, hot and glittering. Where
were humans who needed such an instrument?</p>

<p>Blood thrummed and beat behind his eyes. He closed them.</p>

<p>Panic came to him. The day was passing. I am lying here, he thought,
and my life slips away. I cannot move. My youth is passing. How long
before I can move?</p>

<p>Through a kind of porthole he saw the night pass, the day come, the day
pass, and again another night. Stars danced frostily.</p>

<p>I will lie here for four or five days, wrinkling and withering, he
thought. This ship will not let me move. How much better if I had
stayed in my home cliff, lived, enjoyed this short life. What good has
it done to come here? I'm missing all the twilights and dawns. I'll
never touch Lyte, though she's here at my side.</p>

<p>Delirium. His mind floated up. His thoughts whirled through the metal
ship. He smelled the razor sharp smell of joined metal. He heard the
hull contract with night, relax with day.</p>

<p>Dawn.</p>

<p>Already&mdash;another dawn!</p>

<p>Today I would have been mature. His jaw clenched. I must get up. I must
move. I must enjoy my time of maturity.</p>

<p>But he didn't move. He felt his blood pump sleepily from chamber to red
chamber in his heart, on down and around through his dead body, to be
purified by his folding and unfolding lungs. Then the circuit once more.</p>

<p>The ship grew warm. From somewhere a machine clicked. Automatically the
temperature cooled. A controlled gust of air flushed the room.</p>

<p>Night again. And then another day.</p>

<p>He lay and saw four days of his life pass.</p>

<p>He did not try to fight. It was no use. His life was over.</p>

<p>He didn't want to turn his head now. He didn't want to see Lyte with
her face like his tortured mother's&mdash;eyelids like gray ash flakes, eyes
like beaten, sanded metal, cheeks like eroded stones. He didn't want to
see a throat like parched thongs of yellow grass, hands the pattern of
smoke risen from a fire, breasts like desiccated rinds and hair stubbly
and unshorn as moist gray weeds!</p>

<p>And himself? How did <i>he</i> look? Was his jaw sunken, the flesh of his
eyes pitted, his brow lined and age-scarred?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His strength began to return. He felt his heart beating so slow that it
was amazing. One hundred beats a minute. Impossible. He felt so cool,
so thoughtful, so easy.</p>

<p>His head fell over to one side. He stared at Lyte. He shouted in
surprise.</p>

<p>She was young and fair.</p>

<p>She was looking at him, too weak to say anything. Her eyes were like
tiny silver medals, her throat curved like the arm of a child. Her hair
was blue fire eating at her scalp, fed by the slender life of her body.</p>

<p>Four days had passed and still she was young ... no, younger than when
they had entered the ship. She was still adolescent.</p>

<p>He could not believe it.</p>

<p>Her first words were, "How long will this last?"</p>

<p>He replied, carefully. "I don't know."</p>

<p>"We are still young."</p>

<p>"The ship. Its metal is around us. It cuts away the sun and the things
that came from the sun to age us."</p>

<p>Her eyes shifted thoughtfully. "Then, if we stay here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll remain young."</p>

<p>"Six more days? Fourteen more? Twenty?"</p>

<p>"More than that, maybe."</p>

<p>She lay there, silently. After a long time she said, "Sim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Let's stay here. Let's not go back. If we go back now, you know
what'll happen to us...?"</p>

<p>"I'm not certain."</p>

<p>"We'll start getting old again, won't we?"</p>

<p>He looked away. He stared at the ceiling and the clock with the moving
finger. "Yes. We'll grow old."</p>

<p>"What if we grow old&mdash;instantly. When we step from the ship won't the
shock be too much?"</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Another silence. He began to move his limbs, testing them. He was very
hungry. "The others are waiting," he said.</p>

<p>Her next words made him gasp. "The others are dead," she said. "Or will
be in a few hours. All those we knew back there are old and worn."</p>

<p>He tried to picture them old. Dark, his sister, bent and senile with
time. He shook his head, wiping the picture away. "They may die," he
said. "But there are others who've been born."</p>

<p>"People we don't even know," said Lyte, flatly.</p>

<p>"But, nevertheless, <i>our</i> people," he replied. "People who'll live only
eight days, or eleven days unless we help them."</p>

<p>"But we're <i>young</i>, Sim! We're young! We can <i>stay</i> young!"</p>

<p>He didn't want to listen. It was too tempting a thing to listen to. To
stay here. To live. "We've already had more time than the others," he
said. "I need workers. Men to heal this ship. We'll get on our feet
now, you and I, and find food, eat, and see if the ship is movable. I'm
afraid to try to move it myself. It's so big. I'll need help."</p>

<p>"But that means running back all that distance!"</p>

<p>"I know." He lifted himself weakly. "But I'll do it."</p>

<p>"How will you get the men back here?"</p>

<p>"We'll use the river."</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> it's there. It <i>may</i> be somewhere else."</p>

<p>"We'll wait until there <i>is</i> one, then. I've got to go back, Lyte.
The son of Dienc is waiting for me, my sister, your brother, are old
people, ready to die, and waiting for some word from us&mdash;"</p>

<p>After a long while he heard her move, dragging herself tiredly to him.
She put her head upon his chest, her eyes closed, stroking his arm.
"I'm sorry. Forgive me. You have to go back. I'm a selfish fool."</p>

<p>He touched her cheek, clumsily. "You're human. I understand you.
There's nothing to forgive."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They found food. They walked through the ship. It was empty. Only in
the control room did they find the remains of a man who must have been
the chief pilot. The others had evidently bailed out into space in
emergency lifeboats. This pilot, sitting at his controls, alone, had
landed the ship on a mountain within sight of other fallen and smashed
crafts. Its location on high ground had saved it from the floods. The
pilot himself had died, probably of heart failure, soon after landing.
The ship had remained here, almost within reach of the other survivors,
perfect as an egg, but silent, for&mdash;how many thousand days? If the
pilot had lived, what a different thing life might have been for the
ancestors of Sim and Lyte. Sim, thinking of this&mdash;felt the distant,
ominous vibration of war. How had the war between worlds come out? Who
had won? Or had both planets lost and never bothered trying to pick up
survivors? Who had been right? Who was the enemy? Were Sim's people of
the guilty or innocent side? They might never know.</p>

<p>He checked the ship hurriedly. He knew nothing of its workings, yet
as he walked its corridors, patted its machines, he learned from it.
It needed only a crew. One man couldn't possibly set the whole thing
running again. He laid his hand upon one round, snout-like machine. He
jerked his hand away, as if burnt.</p>

<p>"Lyte!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>He touched the machine again, caressed it, his hand trembled violently,
his eyes welled with tears, his mouth opened and closed, he looked at
the machine, loving it, then looked at Lyte.</p>

<p>"With this machine&mdash;" he stammered, softly, incredulously. "With&mdash;with
this machine I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, Sim?"</p>

<p>He inserted his hand into a cup-like contraption with a lever inside.
Out of porthole in front of him he could see the distant line of
cliffs. "We were afraid there might never be another river running by
this mountain, weren't we?" he asked, exultantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sim, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There <i>will</i> be a river. And I <i>will</i> come back, tonight! And I'll
bring men with me. Five hundred men! Because with this machine I can
blast a river bottom all the way to the cliffs, down which the waters
will rush, giving myself and the men a swift, sure way of traveling
back!" He rubbed the machine's barrel-like body. "When I touched it,
the life and method of it shot into me! Watch!" He depressed the lever.</p>

<p>A beam of incandescent fire lanced out from the ship, screaming.</p>

<p>Steadily, accurately, Sim began to cut away a river bed for the storm
waters to flow in. The night was turned to day by its hungry eating.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The return to the cliffs was to be carried out by Sim alone. Lyte was
to remain in the ship, in case of any mishap. The trip back seemed, at
first glance, to be impossible. There would be no river rushing to cut
his time, to sweep him along toward his destination. He would have to
run the entire distance in the dawn, and the sun would get him, catch
him before he'd reached safety.</p>

<p>"The only way to do it is to start <i>before</i> sunrise."</p>

<p>"But you'd be frozen, Sim."</p>

<p>"Here." He made adjustments on the machine that had just finished
cutting the river bed in the rock floor of the valley. He lifted the
smooth snout of the gun, pressed the lever, left it down. A gout of
fire shot toward the cliffs. He fingered the range control, focused the
flame end three miles from its source. Done. He turned to Lyte. "But I
don't understand," she said.</p>

<p>He opened the air-lock door. "It's bitter cold out, and half an hour
yet till dawn. If I run parallel to the flame from the machine, close
enough to it, there'll not be much heat but enough to sustain life,
anyway."</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound safe," Lyte protested.</p>

<p>"<i>Nothing</i> does, on this world." He moved forward. "I'll have a half
hour start. That should be enough to reach the cliffs."</p>

<p>"But if the machine should fail while you're still running near its
beam?"</p>

<p>"Let's not think of that," he said.</p>

<p>A moment later he was outside. He staggered as if kicked in the
stomach. His heart almost exploded in him. The environment of his
world forced him into swift living again. He felt his pulse rise,
kicking through his veins.</p>

<p>The night was cold as death. The heat ray from the ship sliced across
the valley, humming, solid and warm. He moved next to it, very close.
One misstep in his running and&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll be back," he called to Lyte.</p>

<p>He and the ray of light went together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the early morning the peoples in the caves saw the long finger of
orange incandescence and the weird whitish apparition floating, running
along beside it. There was muttering and superstition.</p>

<p>So when Sim finally reached the cliffs of his childhood he saw alien
peoples swarming there. There were no familiar faces. Then he realized
how foolish it was to expect familiar faces. One of the older men
glared down at him. "Who're you?" he shouted. "Are you from the enemy
cliff? What's your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Sim, the son of Sim!"</p>

<p>"Sim!"</p>

<p>An old woman shrieked from the cliff above him. She came hobbling down
the stone pathway. "Sim, Sim, it <i>is</i> you!"</p>

<p>He looked at her, frankly bewildered. "But I don't know you," he
murmured.</p>

<p>"Sim, don't you recognize me? Oh, Sim, it's me! Dark!"</p>

<p>"Dark!"</p>

<p>He felt sick at his stomach. She fell into his arms. This old,
trembling woman with the half-blind eyes, his sister.</p>

<p>Another face appeared above. That of an old man. A cruel, bitter face.
It looked down at Sim and snarled. "Drive him away!" cried the old
man. "He comes from the cliff of the enemy. He's lived there! He's
still young! Those who go there can never come back among us. Disloyal
beast!" And a rock hurtled down.</p>

<p>Sim leaped aside, pulling the old woman with him.</p>

<p>A roar came from the people. They ran toward Sim, shaking their fists.
"Kill him, kill him!" raved the old man, and Sim did not know who he
was.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Sim held out his hands. "I come from the ship!"</p>

<p>"The ship?" The people slowed. Dark clung to him, looking up into his
young face, puzzling over its smoothness.</p>

<p>"Kill him, kill him, kill him!" croaked the old man, and picked up
another rock.</p>

<p>"I offer you ten days, twenty days, thirty more days of life!"</p>

<p>The people stopped. Their mouths hung open. Their eyes were incredulous.</p>

<p>"Thirty days?" It was repeated again and again. "How?"</p>

<p>"Come back to the ship with me. Inside it, one can live forever!"</p>

<p>The old man lifted high a rock, then, choking, fell forward in an
apoplectic fit, and tumbled down the rocks to lie at Sim's feet.</p>

<p>Sim bent to peer at the ancient one, at the bleary, dead eyes, the
loose, sneering lips, the crumpled, quiet body.</p>

<p>"Chion!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dark behind him, in a croaking, strange voice. "Your enemy.
Chion."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night a thousand warriors started for the ship as if going to war.
The water ran in the new channel. Five hundred of them were drowned or
lost behind in the cold. The others, with Sim, got through to the ship.</p>

<p>Lyte awaited them, and threw wide the metal door.</p>

<p>The weeks passed. Generations lived and died in the cliffs, while the
five hundred workers labored over the ship, learning its functions and
its parts.</p>

<p>On the last day they disbanded. Each ran to his station. Now there was
a destiny of travel who still remained behind.</p>

<p>Sim touched the control plates under his fingers.</p>

<p>Lyte, rubbing her eyes, came and sat on the floor next to him, resting
her head against his knee, drowsily. "I had a dream," she said, looking
off at something far away. "I dreamed I lived in caves in a cliff on a
cold-hot planet where people grew old and died in eight days and were
burnt."</p>

<p>"What an impossible dream," said Sim. "People couldn't possibly live in
such a nightmare. Forget it. You're awake now."</p>

<p>He touched the plates gently. The ship rose and moved into space. Sim
was right. The nightmare was over at last.</p>

<h1>LORELEI OF THE RED MIST</h1>
<p>The Company dicks were good. They were plenty good. Hugh Starke began
to think maybe this time he wasn't going to get away with it.</p>

<p>His small stringy body hunched over the control bank, nursing the last
ounce of power out of the Kallman. The hot night sky of Venus fled past
the ports in tattered veils of indigo. Starke wasn't sure where he was
any more. Venus was a frontier planet, and still mostly a big X, except
to the Venusians&mdash;who weren't sending out any maps. He did know that
he was getting dangerously close to the Mountains of White Cloud. The
backbone of the planet, towering far into the stratosphere, magnetic
trap, with God knew what beyond. Maybe even God wasn't sure.</p>

<p>But it looked like over the mountains or out. Death under the guns of
the Terro-Venus Mines, Incorporated, Special Police, or back to the
Luna cell blocks for life as an habitual felon.</p>

<p>Starke decided he would go over.</p>

<p>Whatever happened, he'd pulled off the biggest lone-wolf caper in
history. The T-V Mines payroll ship, for close to a million credits. He
cuddled the metal strongbox between his feet and grinned. It would be a
long time before anybody equaled that.</p>

<p>His mass indicators began to jitter. Vaguely, a dim purple shadow in
the sky ahead, the Mountains of White Cloud stood like a wall against
him. Starke checked the positions of the pursuing ships. There was no
way through them. He said flatly, "All right, damn you," and sent the
Kallman angling up into the thick blue sky.</p>

<p>He had no very clear memories after that. Crazy magnetic vagaries,
always a hazard on Venus, made his instruments useless. He flew by the
seat of his pants and he got over, and the T-V men didn't. He was free,
with a million credits in his kick.</p>

<p>Far below in the virgin darkness he saw a sullen crimson smear on the
night, as though someone had rubbed it with a bloody thumb. The Kallman
dipped toward it. The control bank flickered with blue flame, the jet
timers blew, and then there was just the screaming of air against the
falling hull.</p>

<p>Hugh Starke sat still and waited....</p>

<p>He knew, before he opened his eyes, that he was dying. He didn't feel
any pain, he didn't feel anything, but he knew just the same. Part of
him was cut loose. He was still there, but not attached any more.</p>

<p>He raised his eyelids. There was a ceiling. It was a long way off. It
was black stone veined with smoky reds and ambers. He had never seen it
before.</p>

<p>His head was tilted toward the right. He let his gaze move down that
way. There were dim tapestries, more of the black stone, and three tall
archways giving onto a balcony. Beyond the balcony was a sky veiled and
clouded with red mist. Under the mist, spreading away from a murky line
of cliffs, was an ocean. It wasn't water and it didn't have any waves
on it, but there was nothing else to call it. It burned, deep down
inside itself, breathing up the red fog. Little angry bursts of flame
coiled up under the flat surface, sending circles of sparks flaring out
like ripples from a dropped stone.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and frowned and moved his head restively. There was
the texture of fur against his skin. Through the cracks of his eyelids
he saw that he lay on a high bed piled with silks and soft tanned
pelts. His body was covered. He was rather glad he couldn't see it. It
didn't matter because he wouldn't be using it any more anyway, and it
hadn't been such a hell of a body to begin with. But he was used to it,
and he didn't want to see it now, the way he knew it would have to look.</p>

<p>He looked along over the foot of the bed, and he saw the woman.</p>

<p>She sat watching him from a massive carved chair softened with a single
huge white pelt like a drift of snow. She smiled, and let him look. A
pulse began to beat under his jaw, very feebly.</p>

<p>She was tall and sleek and insolently curved. She wore a sort of tabard
of pale grey spider-silk, held to her body by a jeweled girdle, but it
was just a nice piece of ornamentation. Her face was narrow, finely
cut, secret, faintly amused. Her lips, her eyes, and her flowing silken
hair were all the same pale cool shade of aquamarine.</p>

<p>Her skin was white, with no hint of rose. Her shoulders, her forearms,
the long flat curve of her thighs, the pale-green tips of her breasts,
were dusted with tiny particles that glistened like powdered diamond.
She sparkled softly like a fairy thing against the snowy fur, a
creature of foam and moonlight and clear shallow water. Her eyes never
left his, and they were not human, but he knew that they would have
done things to him if he had had any feeling below the neck.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He started to speak. He had no strength to move his tongue. The woman
leaned forward, and as though her movement were a signal four men rose
from the tapestried shadows by the wall. They were like her. Their eyes
were pale and strange like hers.</p>

<p>She said, in liquid High Venusian, "You're dying, in this body. But
<i>you</i> will not die. You will sleep now, and wake in a strange body,
in a strange place. Don't be afraid. My mind will be with yours, I'll
guide you, don't be afraid. I can't explain now, there isn't time, but
don't be afraid."</p>

<p>He drew back his thin lips baring his teeth in what might have been a
smile. If it was, it was wolfish and bitter, like his face.</p>

<p>The woman's eyes began to pour coolness into his skull. They were
like two little rivers running through the channels of his own eyes,
spreading in silver-green quiet across the tortured surface of his
brain. His brain relaxed. It lay floating on the water, and then the
twin streams became one broad flowing stream, and his mind, or ego, the
thing that was intimately himself, vanished along it.</p>

<p>It took him a long, long time to regain consciousness. He felt as
though he'd been shaken until pieces of him were scattered all over
inside. Also, he had an instinctive premonition that the minute he woke
up he would be sorry he had. He took it easy, putting himself together.</p>

<p>He remembered his name, Hugh Starke. He remembered the mining asteroid
where he was born. He remembered the Luna cell blocks where he had
once come near dying. There wasn't much to choose between them. He
remembered his face decorating half the bulletin boards between Mercury
and The Belt. He remembered hearing about himself over the telecasts,
stuff to frighten babies with, and he thought of himself committing his
first crime&mdash;a stunted scrawny kid of eighteen swinging a spanner on a
grown man who was trying to steal his food.</p>

<p>The rest of it came fast, then. The T-V Mines job, the getaway that
didn't get, the Mountains of White Cloud. The crash....</p>

<p>The woman.</p>

<p>That did it. His brain leaped shatteringly. Light, feeling, a naked
sense of reality swept over him. He lay perfectly still with his eyes
shut, and his mind clawed at the picture of the shining woman with
sea-green hair and the sound of her voice saying, <i>You will not die,
you will wake in a strange body, don't be afraid....</i></p>

<p>He was afraid. His skin pricked and ran cold with it. His stomach
knotted with it. His skin, his stomach, and yet somehow they didn't
feel just right, like a new coat that hasn't shaped to you....</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, a cautious crack.</p>

<p>He saw a body sprawled on its side in dirty straw. The body belonged
to him, because he could feel the straw pricking it, and the itch of
little things that crawled and ate and crawled again.</p>

<p>It was a powerful body, rangy and flat-muscled, much bigger than his
old one. It had obviously not been starved the first twenty-some years
of its life. It was stark naked. Weather and violence had written
history on it, wealed white marks on leathery bronze, but nothing
seemed to be missing. There was black hair on its chest and thighs and
forearms, and its hands were lean and sinewy for killing.</p>

<p>It was a human body. That was something. There were so many other
things it might have been that his racial snobbery wouldn't call human.
Like the nameless shimmering creature who smiled with strange pale lips.</p>

<p>Starke shut his eyes again.</p>

<p>He lay, the intangible self that was Hugh Starke, bellied down in the
darkness of the alien shell, quiet, indrawn, waiting. Panic crept up
on its soft black paws. It walked around the crouching ego and sniffed
and patted and nuzzled, whining, and then struck with its raking claws.
After a while it went away, empty.</p>

<p>The lips that were now Starke's lips twitched in a thin, cruel smile.
He had done six months once in the Luna solitary crypts. If a man
could do that, and come out sane and on his two feet, he could stand
anything. Even this.</p>

<p>It came to him then, rather deflatingly, that the woman and her four
companions had probably softened the shock by hypnotic suggestion.
His subconscious understood and accepted the change. It was only his
conscious mind that was superficially scared to death.</p>

<p>Hugh Starke cursed the woman with great thoroughness, in seven
languages and some odd dialects. He became healthily enraged that any
dame should play around with him like that. Then he thought, What the
hell, I'm alive. And it looks like I got the best of the trade-in!</p>

<p>He opened his eyes again, secretly, on his new world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He lay at one end of a square stone hall, good sized, with two straight
lines of pillars cut from some dark Venusian wood. There were long
crude benches and tables. Fires had been burning on round brick hearths
spaced between the pillars. They were embers now. The smoke climbed
up, tarnishing the gold and bronze of shields hung on the walls and
pediments, dulling the blades of longswords, the spears, the tapestries
and hides and trophies.</p>

<p>It was very quiet in the hall. Somewhere outside of it there was
fighting going on. Heavy, vicious fighting. The noise of it didn't
touch the silence, except to make it deeper.</p>

<p>There were two men besides Starke in the hall.</p>

<p>They were close to him, on a low dais. One of them sat in a carved high
seat, not moving, his big scarred hands flat on the table in front of
him. The other crouched on the floor by his feet. His head was bent
forward so that his mop of lint-white hair hid his face and the harp
between his thighs. He was a little man, a swamp-edger from his albino
coloring. Starke looked back at the man in the chair.</p>

<p>The man spoke harshly. "Why doesn't she send word?"</p>

<p>The harp gave out a sudden bitter chord. That was all.</p>

<p>Starke hardly noticed. His whole attention was drawn to the speaker.
His heart began to pound. His muscles coiled and lay ready. There was
a bitter taste in his mouth. He recognized it. It was hate.</p>

<p>He had never seen the man before, but his hands twitched with the urge
to kill.</p>

<p>He was big, nearly seven feet, and muscled like a draft horse. But his
body, naked above a gold-bossed leather kilt, was lithe and quick as a
greyhound in spite of its weight. His face was square, strong-boned,
weathered, and still young. It was a face that had laughed a lot once,
and liked wine and pretty girls. It had forgotten those things now,
except maybe the wine. It was drawn and cruel with pain, a look as of
something in a cage. Starke had seen that look before, in the Luna
blocks. There was a thick white scar across the man's forehead. Under
it his blue eyes were sunken and dark behind half-closed lids. The man
was blind.</p>

<p>Outside, in the distance, men screamed and died.</p>

<p>Starke had been increasingly aware of a soreness and stricture around
his neck. He raised a hand, careful not to rustle the straw. His
fingers found a long tangled beard, felt under it, and touched a band
of metal.</p>

<p>Starke's new body wore a collar, like a vicious dog.</p>

<p>There was a chain attached to the collar. Starke couldn't find any
fastening. The business had been welded on for keeps. His body didn't
seem to have liked it much. The neck was galled and chafed.</p>

<p>The blood began to crawl up hot into Starke's head. He'd worn chains
before. He didn't like them. Especially around the neck.</p>

<p>A door opened suddenly at the far end of the hall. Fog and red daylight
spilled in across the black stone floor. A man came in. He was big,
half naked, blond, and bloody. His long blade trailed harshly on the
flags. His chest was laid open to the bone and he held the wound
together with his free hand.</p>

<p>"Word from Beudag," he said. "They've driven us back into the city, but
so far we're holding the Gate."</p>

<p>No one spoke. The little man nodded his white head. The man with the
slashed chest turned and went out again, closing the door.</p>

<p>A peculiar change came over Starke at the mention of the name Beudag.
He had never heard it before, but it hung in his mind like a spear
point, barbed with strange emotion. He couldn't identify the feeling,
but it brushed the blind man aside. The hot simple hatred cooled.
Starke relaxed in a sort of icy quiet, deceptively calm as a sleeping
cobra. He didn't question this. He waited, for Beudag.</p>

<p>The blind man struck his hands down suddenly on the table and stood up.
"Romna," he said, "give me my sword."</p>

<p>The little man looked at him. He had milk-blue eyes and a face like a
friendly bulldog. He said, "Don't be a fool, Faolan."</p>

<p>Faolan said softly, "Damn you. Give me my sword."</p>

<p>Men were dying outside the hall, and not dying silently. Faolan's skin
was greasy with sweat. He made a sudden, darting grab toward Romna.</p>

<p>Romna dodged him. There were tears in his pale eyes. He said brutally,
"You'd only be in the way. Sit down."</p>

<p>"I can find the point," Faolan said, "to fall on it."</p>

<p>Romna's voice went up to a harsh scream. "Shut up. Shut up and sit
down."</p>

<p>Faolan caught the edge of the table and bent over it. He shivered and
closed his eyes, and the tears ran out hot under the lids. The bard
turned away, and his harp cried out like a woman.</p>

<p>Faolan drew a long sighing breath. He straightened slowly, came round
the carved high seat, and walked steadily toward Starke.</p>

<p>"You're very quiet, Conan," he said. "What's the matter? You ought to
be happy, Conan. You ought to laugh and rattle your chain. You're going
to get what you wanted. Are you sad because you haven't a mind any
more, to understand that with?"</p>

<p>He stopped and felt with one sandaled foot across the straw until he
touched Starke's thigh. Starke lay motionless.</p>

<p>"Conan," said the blind man gently, pressing Starke's belly with his
foot. "Conan the dog, the betrayer, the butcher, the knife in the back.
Remember what you did at Falga, Conan? No, you don't remember now. I've
been a little rough with you, and you don't remember any more. But I
remember, Conan. As long as I live in darkness, I'll remember."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Romna stroked the harp strings and they wept, savage tears for strong
men dead of treachery. Low music, distant but not soft. Faolan began to
tremble, a shallow animal twitching of the muscles. The flesh of his
face was drawn, iron shaping under the hammer. Quite suddenly he went
down on his knees. His hands struck Starke's shoulders, slid inward to
the throat, and locked there.</p>

<p>Outside, the sound of fighting had died away.</p>

<p>Starke moved, very quickly. As though he had seen it and knew it was
there, his hand swept out and gathered in the slack of the heavy chain
and swung it.</p>

<p>It started out to be a killing blow. Starke wanted with all his heart
to beat Faolan's brains out. But at the last second he pulled it,
slapping the big man with exquisite judgment across the back of the
head. Faolan grunted and fell sideways, and by that time Romna had come
up. He had dropped his harp and drawn a knife. His eyes were startled.</p>

<p>Starke sprang up. He backed off, swinging the slack of the chain
warningly. His new body moved magnificently. Outside everything was
fine, but inside his psycho-neural setup had exploded into civil war.
He was furious with himself for not having killed Faolan. He was
furious with himself for losing control enough to want to kill a man
without reason. He hated Faolan. He did not hate Faolan because he
didn't know him well enough. Starke's trained, calculating, unemotional
brain was at grips with a tidal wave of baseless emotion.</p>

<p>He hadn't realized it was baseless until his mental monitor,
conditioned through years of bitter control, had stopped him from
killing. Now he remembered the woman's voice saying, <i>My mind will be
with yours, I'll guide you....</i></p>

<p>Catspaw, huh? Just a hired hand, paid off with a new body in return for
two lives. Yeah, two. This Beudag, whoever he was. Starke knew now what
that cold alien emotion had been leading up to.</p>

<p>"Hold it," said Starke hoarsely. "Hold everything. <i>Catspaw! You
green-eyed she-devil! You picked the wrong guy this time.</i>"</p>

<p>Just for a fleeting instant he saw her again, leaning forward with her
hair like running water across the soft foam-sparkle of her shoulders.
Her sea-pale eyes were full of mocking laughter, and a direct,
provocative admiration. Starke heard her quite plainly:</p>

<p>"You may not have any choice, Hugh Starke. They know Conan, even if
you don't. Besides, it's of no great importance. The end will be the
same for them&mdash;it's just a matter of time. You can save your new body
or not, as you wish." She smiled. "I'd like it if you did. It's a good
body. I knew it, before Conan's mind broke and left it empty."</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to Starke. "My box, the million credits."</p>

<p>"Come and get them." She was gone. Starke's mind was clear, with no
alien will tramping around in it. Faolan crouched on the floor, holding
his head. He said:</p>

<p>"Who spoke?"</p>

<p>Romna the bard stood staring. His lips moved, but no sound came out.</p>

<p>Starke said, "I spoke. Me, Hugh Starke. I'm not Conan, and I never
heard of Falga, and I'll brain the first guy that comes near me."</p>

<p>Faolan stayed motionless, his face blank, his breath sobbing in his
throat. Romna began to curse, very softly, not as though he were
thinking about it. Starke watched them.</p>

<p>Down the hall the doors burst open. The heavy reddish mist coiled in
with the daylight across the flags, and with them a press of bodies hot
from battle, bringing a smell of blood.</p>

<p>Starke felt the heart contract in the hairy breast of the body named
Conan, watching the single figure that led the pack.</p>

<p>Romna called out, "Beudag!"</p>

<p>She was tall. She was built and muscled like a lioness, and she walked
with a flat-hipped arrogance, and her hair was like coiled flame. Her
eyes were blue, hot and bright, as Faolan's might have been once.
She looked like Faolan. She was dressed like him, in a leather kilt
and sandals, her magnificent body bare above the waist. She carried
a longsword slung across her back, the hilt standing above the left
shoulder. She had been using it. Her skin was smeared with blood and
grime. There was a long cut on her thigh and another across her flat
belly, and bitter weariness lay on her like a burden in spite of her
denial of it.</p>

<p>"We've stopped them, Faolan," she said. "They can't breach the Gate,
and we can hold Crom Dhu as long as we have food. And the sea feeds
us." She laughed, but there was a hollow sound to it. "Gods, I'm tired!"</p>

<p>She halted then, below the dais. Her flame-blue gaze swept across
Faolan, across Romna, and rose to meet Hugh Starke's, and stayed there.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus1.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The pulse began to beat under Starke's jaw again, and this time his
body was strong, and the pulse was like a drum throbbing.</p>

<p>Romna said, "His mind has come back."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a long, hard silence. No one in the hall moved. Then the men
back of Beudag, big brawny kilted warriors, began to close in on the
dais, talking in low snarling undertones that rose toward a mob howl.
Faolan rose up and faced them, and bellowed them to quiet.</p>

<p>"He's mine to take! Let him alone."</p>

<p>Beudag sprang up onto the dais, one beautiful flowing movement. "It
isn't possible," she said. "His mind broke under torture. He's been
a drooling idiot with barely the sense to feed himself. And now,
suddenly, you say he's normal again?"</p>

<p>Starke said, "You know I'm normal. You can see it in my eyes."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He didn't like the way she said that. "Listen, my name is Hugh Starke.
I'm an Earthman. This isn't Conan's brain come back. This is a new
deal. I got shoved into this body. What it did before I got it I don't
know, and I'm not responsible."</p>

<p>Faolan said, "He doesn't remember Falga. He doesn't remember the
longships at the bottom of the sea." Faolan laughed.</p>

<p>Romna said quietly, "He didn't kill you, though. He could have, easily.
Would Conan have spared you?"</p>

<p>Beudag said, "Yes, if he had a better plan. Conan's mind was like a
snake. It crawled in the dark, and you never knew where it was going to
strike."</p>

<p>Starke began to tell them how it happened, the chain swinging idly in
his hand. While he was talking he saw a face reflected in a polished
shield hung on a pillar. Mostly it was just a tangled black mass of
hair, mounted on a frame of long, harsh, jutting bone. The mouth was
sensuous, with a dark sort of laughter on it. The eyes were yellow. The
cruel, brilliant yellow of a killer hawk.</p>

<p>Starke realized with a shock that the face belonged to him.</p>

<p>"A woman with pale green hair," said Beudag softly. "Rann," said
Faolan, and Romna's harp made a sound like a high-priest's curse.</p>

<p>"Her people have that power," Romna said. "They can think a man's soul
into a spider, and step on it."</p>

<p>"They have many powers. Maybe Rann followed Conan's mind, wherever it
went, and told it what to say, and brought it back again."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Starke angrily. "I didn't ask...."</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, Romna drew Beudag's sword and threw it at
Starke.</p>

<p>Starke dodged it. He looked at Romna with ugly yellow eyes. "That's
fine. Chain me up so I can't fight and kill me from a distance." He
did not pick up the sword. He'd never used one. The chain felt better,
not being too different from a heavy belt or a length of cable, or the
other chains he'd swung on occasion.</p>

<p>Romna said, "Is that Conan?"</p>

<p>Faolan snarled, "What happened?"</p>

<p>"Romna threw my sword at Conan. He dodged it, and left it on the
ground." Beudag's eyes were narrowed. "Conan could catch a flying sword
by the hilt, and he was the best fighter on the Red Sea, barring you,
Faolan."</p>

<p>"He's trying to trick us. Rann guides him."</p>

<p>"The hell with Rann!" Starke clashed his chain. "She wants me to kill
the both of you, I still don't know why. All right. I could have killed
Faolan, easy. But I'm not a killer. I never put down anyone except to
save my own neck. So I didn't kill him in spite of Rann. And I don't
want any part of you, or Rann either. All I want is to get the hell out
of here!"</p>

<p>Beudag said, "His accent isn't Conan's. And the look in his eyes is
different, too." Her voice had an odd note in it. Romna glanced at her.
He fingered a few rippling chords on his harp, and said:</p>

<p>"There's one way you could tell for sure."</p>

<p>A sullen flush began to burn on Beudag's cheekbones. Romna slid
unobtrusively out of reach. His eyes danced with malicious laughter.</p>

<p>Beudag smiled, the smile of an angry cat, all teeth and no humor.
Suddenly she walked toward Starke, her head erect, her hands swinging
loose and empty at her sides. Starke tensed warily, but the blood
leaped pleasantly in his borrowed veins.</p>

<p>Beudag kissed him.</p>

<p>Starke dropped the chain. He had something better to do with his hands.</p>

<p>After a while he raised his head for breath, and she stepped back, and
whispered wonderingly,</p>

<p>"It isn't Conan."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hall had been cleared. Starke had washed and shaved himself. His
new face wasn't bad. Not bad at all. In fact, it was pretty damn good.
And it wasn't known around the System. It was a face that could own a
million credits and no questions asked. It was a face that could have a
lot of fun on a million credits.</p>

<p>All he had to figure out now was a way to save the neck the face was
mounted on, and get his million credits back from that beautiful
she-devil named Rann.</p>

<p>He was still chained, but the straw had been cleaned up and he wore
a leather kilt and a pair of sandals. Faolan sat in his high seat
nursing a flagon of wine. Beudag sprawled wearily on a fur rug beside
him. Romna sat cross-legged, his eyes veiled sleepily, stroking soft
wandering music out of his harp. He looked fey. Starke knew his
swamp-edgers. He wasn't surprised.</p>

<p>"This man is telling the truth," Romna said. "But there's another mind
touching his. Rann's, I think. Don't trust him."</p>

<p>Faolan growled, "I couldn't trust a god in Conan's body."</p>

<p>Starke said, "What's the setup? All the fighting out there, and this
Rann dame trying to plant a killer on the inside. And what happened at
Falga? I never heard of this whole damn ocean, let alone a place called
Falga."</p>

<p>The bard swept his hand across the strings. "I'll tell you, Hugh
Starke. And maybe you won't want to stay in that body any longer."</p>

<p>Starke grinned. He glanced at Beudag. She was watching him with a queer
intensity from under lowered lids. Starke's grin changed. He began
to sweat. Get rid of this body, hell! It was really a body. His own
stringy little carcass had never felt like this.</p>

<p>The bard said, "In the beginning, in the Red Sea, was a race of people
having still their fins and scales. They were amphibious, but after a
while part of this race wanted to remain entirely on land. There was
a quarrel, and a battle, and some of the people left the sea forever.
They settled along the shore. They lost their fins and most of their
scales. They had great mental powers and they loved ruling. They
subjugated the human peoples and kept them almost in slavery. They
hated their brothers who still lived in the sea, and their brothers
hated them.</p>

<p>"After a time a third people came to the Red Sea. They were rovers from
the North. They raided and rieved and wore no man's collar. They made a
settlement on Crom Dhu, the Black Rock, and built longships, and took
toll of the coastal towns.</p>

<p>"But the slave people didn't want to fight against the rovers. They
wanted to fight with them and destroy the sea-folk. The rovers were
human, and blood calls to blood. And the rovers like to rule, too,
and this is a rich country. Also, the time had come in their tribal
development when they were ready to change from nomadic warriors to
builders in their own country.</p>

<p>"So the rovers, and the sea-folk, and the slave-people who are caught
between the two of them, began their struggle for the land."</p>

<p>The bard's fingers thrummed against the strings so that they beat like
angry hearts. Starke saw that Beudag was still watching him, weighing
every change of expression on his face. Romna went on:</p>

<p>"There was a woman named Rann, who had green hair and great beauty, and
ruled the sea-folk. There was a man called Faolan of the Ships, and
his sister Beudag, which means Dagger-in-the-Sheath, and they two ruled
the outland rovers. And there was the man called Conan."</p>

<p>The harp crashed out like a sword-blade striking.</p>

<p>"Conan was a great fighter and a great lover. He was next under Faolan
of the Ships, and Beudag loved him, and they were plighted. Then Conan
was taken prisoner by the sea-folk during a skirmish, and Rann saw
him&mdash;and Conan saw Rann."</p>

<p>Hugh Starke had a fleeting memory of Rann's face smiling, and her low
voice saying, <i>It's a good body. I knew it, before</i>....</p>

<p>Beudag's eyes were two stones of blue vitriol under her narrow lids.</p>

<p>"Conan stayed a long time at Falga with Rann of the Red Sea. Then he
came back to Crom Dhu, and said that he had escaped, and had discovered
a way to take the longships into the harbor of Falga, at the back of
Rann's fleet, and from there it would be easy to take the city, and
Rann with it. And Conan and Beudag were married."</p>

<p>Starke's yellow hawk eyes slid over Beudag, sprawled like a young
lioness in power and beauty. A muscle began to twitch under his
cheekbone. Beudag flushed, a slow deep color. Her gaze did not waver.</p>

<p>"So the longships went out from Crom Dhu, across the Red Sea. And
Conan led them into a trap at Falga, and more than half of them were
sunk. Conan thought his ship was free, that he had Rann and all she'd
promised him, but Faolan saw what had happened and went after him. They
fought, and Conan laid his sword across Faolan's brow and blinded him;
but Conan lost the fight. Beudag brought them home.</p>

<p>"Conan was chained naked in the market place. The people were careful
not to kill him. From time to time other things were done to him. After
a while his mind broke, and Faolan had him chained here in the hall,
where he could hear him babble and play with his chain. It made the
darkness easier to bear.</p>

<p>"But since Falga, things have gone badly from Crom Dhu. Too many men
were lost, too many ships. Now Rann's people have us bottled up here.
They can't break in, we can't break out. And so we stay, until...." The
harp cried out a bitter question, and was still.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a minute or two Starke said slowly, "Yeah, I get it. Stalemate
for both of you. And Rann figured if I could kill off the leaders,
your people might give up." He began to curse. "What a lousy, dirty,
sneaking trick! And who told her she could use me...." He paused.
After all, he'd be dead now. After all, a new body, and a cool million
credits. Ah, the hell with Rann. He hadn't asked her to do it. And
he was nobody's hired killer. Where did she get off, sneaking around
his mind, trying to make him do things he didn't even know about?
Especially to someone like Beudag.</p>

<p>Still, Rann herself was nobody's crud.</p>

<p>And just where was Hugh Starke supposed to cut in on this deal? Cut was
right. Probably with a longsword, right through the belly. Swell spot
he was in, and a good three strikes on him already.</p>

<p>He was beginning to wish he'd never seen the T-V Mines payroll ship,
because then he might never have seen the Mountains of White Cloud.</p>

<p>He said, because everybody seemed to be waiting for him to say
something, "Usually when there's a deadlock like this, somebody calls
in a third party. Isn't there somebody you can yell for?"</p>

<p>Faolan shook his rough red head. "The slave people might rise, but
they haven't arms and they're not used to fighting. They'd only get
massacred, and it wouldn't help us any."</p>

<p>"What about those other&mdash;uh&mdash;people that live in the sea? And just what
is that sea, anyhow? Some radiation from it wrecked my ship and got me
into this bloody mess."</p>

<p>Beudag said lazily, "I don't know what it is. The seas our forefathers
sailed on were water, but this is different. It will float a ship, if
you know how to build the hull&mdash;very thin, of a white metal we mine
from the foothills. But when you swim in it, it's like being in a cloud
of bubbles. It tingles, and the farther down you go in it the stranger
it gets, dark and full of fire. I stay down for hours sometimes,
hunting the beasts that live there."</p>

<p>Starke said, "For hours? You have diving suits, then."</p>

<p>"What are they?" Starke told her. She shook her head, laughing. "Why
weigh yourself down that way? There's no trouble to breathe in this
ocean."</p>

<p>"For cripesake," said Starke. "Well I'll be damned. Must be a heavy
gas, then, radioactive, surface tension under atmospheric pressure,
enough to float a light hull, and high oxygen content without any
dangerous mixture. Well, well. Okay, why doesn't somebody go down and
see if the sea-people will help? They don't like Rann's branch of the
family, you said."</p>

<p>"They don't like us, either," said Faolan. "We stay out of the southern
part of the sea. They wreck our ships, sometimes." His bitter mouth
twisted in a smile. "Did you want to go to them for help?"</p>

<p>Starke didn't quite like the way Faolan sounded. "It was just a
suggestion," he said.</p>

<p>Beudag rose, stretching, wincing as the stiffened wounds pulled her
flesh. "Come, on, Faolan. Let's sleep."</p>

<p>He rose and laid his hand on her shoulder. Romna's harpstrings breathed
a subtle little mockery of sound. The bard's eyes were veiled and
sleepy. Beudag did not look at Starke, called Conan.</p>

<p>Starke said, "What about me?"</p>

<p>"You stay chained," said Faolan. "There's plenty of time to think. As
long as we have food&mdash;and the sea feeds us."</p>

<p>He followed Beudag, through a curtained entrance to the left. Romna got
up, slowly, slinging the harp over one white shoulder. He stood looking
steadily into Starke's eyes in the dying light of the fires.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he murmured.</p>

<p>Starke waited, not speaking. His face was without expression.</p>

<p>"Conan we knew. Starke we don't know. Perhaps it would have been better
if Conan had come back." He ran his thumb absently over the hilt of the
knife in his girdle. "I don't know. Perhaps it would have been better
for all of us if I'd cut your throat before Beudag came in."</p>

<p>Starke's mouth twitched. It was not exactly a smile.</p>

<p>"You see," said the bard seriously, "to you, from Outside, none of this
is important, except as it touches you. But we live in this little
world. We die in it. To us, it's important."</p>

<p>The knife was in his hand now. It leaped up glittering into the dregs
of the firelight, and fell, and leaped again.</p>

<p>"You fight for yourself, Hugh Starke. Rann also fights through you. I
don't know."</p>

<p>Starke's gaze did not waver.</p>

<p>Romna shrugged and put away the knife. "It is written of the gods," he
said, sighing. "I hope they haven't done a bad job of the writing."</p>

<p>He went out. Starke began to shiver slightly. It was completely quiet
in the hall. He examined his collar, the rivets, every separate link of
the chain, the staple to which it was fixed. Then he sat down on the
fur rug provided for him in place of the straw. He put his face in his
hands and cursed, steadily, for several minutes, and then struck his
fists down hard on the floor. After that he lay down and was quiet. He
thought Rann would speak to him. She did not.</p>

<p>The silent black hours that walked across his heart were worse than any
he had spent in the Luna crypts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She came soft-shod, bearing a candle. Beudag, the Dagger-in-the-Sheath.
Starke was not sleeping. He rose and stood waiting. She set the candle
on the table and came, not quite to him, and stopped. She wore a length
of thin white cloth twisted loosely at the waist and dropping to her
ankles. Her body rose out of it straight and lovely, touched mystically
with shadows in the little wavering light.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she whispered. "What are you?"</p>

<p>"A man. Not Conan. Maybe not Hugh Starke any more. Just a man."</p>

<p>"I loved the man called Conan, until...." She caught her breath, and
moved closer. She put her hand on Starke's arm. The touch went through
him like white fire. The warm clean healthy fragrance of her tasted
sweet in his throat. Her eyes searched his.</p>

<p>"If Rann has such great powers, couldn't it be that Conan was forced to
do what he did? Couldn't it be that Rann took his mind and moulded it
her way, perhaps without his knowing it?"</p>

<p>"It could be."</p>

<p>"Conan was hot-tempered and quarrelsome, but he...."</p>

<p>Starke said slowly, "I don't think you could have loved him if he
hadn't been straight."</p>

<p>Her hand lay still on his forearm. She stood looking at him, and then
her hand began to tremble, and in a moment she was crying, making no
noise about it. Starke drew her gently to him. His eyes blazed yellowly
in the candlelight.</p>

<p>"Woman's tears," she said impatiently, after a bit. She tried to draw
away. "I've been fighting too long, and losing, and I'm tired."</p>

<p>He let her step back, not far. "Do all the women of Crom Dhu fight like
men?"</p>

<p>"If they want to. There have always been shield-maidens. And since
Falga, I would have had to fight anyway, to keep from thinking." She
touched the collar on Starke's neck. "And from seeing."</p>

<p>He thought of Conan in the market square, and Conan shaking his chain
and gibbering in Faolan's hall, and Beudag watching it. Starke's
fingers tightened. He slid his palms upward along the smooth muscles of
her arms, across the straight, broad planes of her shoulders, onto her
neck, the proud strength of it pulsing under his hands. Her hair fell
loose. He could feel the redness of it burning him.</p>

<p>She whispered, "You don't love me."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You're an honest man, Hugh Starke."</p>

<p>"You want me to kiss you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're an honest woman, Beudag."</p>

<p>Her lips were hungry, passionate, touched with the bitterness of tears.
After a while Starke blew out the candle....</p>

<p>"I could love you, Beudag."</p>

<p>"Not the way I mean."</p>

<p>"The way you mean. I've never said that to any woman before. But you're
not like any woman before. And&mdash;I'm a different man."</p>

<p>"Strange&mdash;so strange. Conan, and yet not Conan."</p>

<p>"I could love you, Beudag&mdash;if I lived."</p>

<p>Harpstrings gave a thrumming sigh in the darkness, the faintest whisper
of sound. Beudag started, sighed, and rose from the fur rug. In a
minute she had found flint and steel and got the candle lighted. Romna
the bard stood in the curtained doorway, watching them.</p>

<p>Presently he said, "You're going to let him go."</p>

<p>Beudag said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Romna nodded. He did not seem surprised. He walked across the dais,
laying his harp on the table, and went into another room. He came back
almost at once with a hacksaw.</p>

<p>"Bend your neck," he said to Starke.</p>

<p>The metal of the collar was soft. When it was cut through Starke got
his fingers under it and bent the ends outward, without trouble. His
old body could never have done that. His old body could never have done
a lot of things. He figured Rann hadn't cheated him. Not much.</p>

<p>He got up, looking at Beudag. Beudag's head was dropped forward, her
face veiled behind shining hair.</p>

<p>"There's only one possible way out of Crom Dhu," she said. There was no
emotion in her voice. "There's a passage leading down through the rock
to a secret harbor, just large enough to moor a skiff or two. Perhaps,
with the night and the fog, you can slip through Rann's blockade. Or
you can go aboard one of her ships, for Falga." She picked up the
candle. "I'll take you down."</p>

<p>"Wait," Starke said. "What about you?"</p>

<p>She glanced at him, surprised. "I'll stay, of course."</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes. "It's going to be hard to know each other that
way."</p>

<p>"You can't stay here, Hugh Starke. The people would tear you to pieces
the moment you went into the street. They may even storm the hall, to
take you. Look here." She set the candle down and led him to a narrow
window, drawing back the hide that covered it.</p>

<p>Starke saw narrow twisting streets dropping steeply toward the sullen
sea. The longships were broken and sunk in the harbor. Out beyond,
riding lights flickering in the red fog, were other ships. Rann's ships.</p>

<p>"Over there," said Beudag, "is the mainland. Crom Dhu is connected to
it by a tongue of rock. The sea-folk hold the land beyond it, but we
can hold the rock bridge as long as we live. We have enough water,
enough food from the sea. But there's no soil nor game on Crom Dhu.
We'll be naked after a while, without leather or flax, and we'll have
scurvy without grain and fruit. We're beaten, unless the gods send us
a miracle. And we're beaten because of what was done at Falga. You can
see how the people feel."</p>

<p>Starke looked at the dark streets and the silent houses leaning on each
other's shoulders, and the mocking lights out in the fog. "Yeah," he
said. "I can see."</p>

<p>"Besides, there's Faolan. I don't know whether he believes your story.
I don't know whether it would matter."</p>

<p>Starke nodded. "But you won't come with me?"</p>

<p>She turned away sharply and picked up the candle again. "Are you
coming, Romna?"</p>

<p>The bard nodded. He slung his harp over his shoulder. Beudag held back
the curtain of a small doorway far to the side. Starke went through it
and Romna followed, and Beudag went ahead with the candle. No one spoke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They went along a narrow passage, past store rooms and armories. They
paused once while Starke chose a knife, and Romna whispered: "Wait!"
He listened intently. Starke and Beudag strained their ears along with
him. There was no sound in the sleeping dun. Romna shrugged. "I thought
I heard sandals scraping stone," he said. They went on.</p>

<p>The passage lay behind a wooden door. It led downward steeply through
the rock, a single narrow way without side galleries or branches. In
some places there were winding steps. It ended, finally, in a flat
ledge low to the surface of the cove, which was a small cavern closed
in with the black rock. Beudag set the candle down.</p>

<p>There were two little skiffs built of some light metal moored to rings
in the ledge. Two long sweeps leaned against the cave wall. They were
of a different metal, oddly vaned. Beudag laid one across the thwarts
of the nearest boat. Then she turned to Starke. Romna hung back in the
shadows by the tunnel mouth.</p>

<p>Beudag said quietly, "Goodbye, man without a name."</p>

<p>"It has to be goodbye."</p>

<p>"I'm leader now, in Faolan's place. Besides, these are my people."
Her fingers tightened on his wrists. "If you could...." Her eyes held
a brief blaze of hope. Then she dropped her head and said, "I keep
forgetting you're not one of us. Goodbye."</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Beudag."</p>

<p>Starke put his arms around her. He found her mouth, almost cruelly. Her
arms were tight about him, her eyes half closed and dreaming. Starke's
hands slip upward, toward her throat, and locked on it.</p>

<p>She bent back, her body like a steel bow. Her eyes got fire in them,
looking into Starke's but only for a moment. His fingers pressed
expertly on the nerve centers. Beudag's head fell forward limply, and
then Romna was on Starke's back and his knife was pricking Starke's
throat.</p>

<p>Starke caught his wrist and turned the blade away. Blood ran onto his
chest, but the cut was not into the artery. He threw himself backward
onto the stone. Romna couldn't get clear in time. The breath went out
of him in a rushing gasp. He didn't let go of the knife. Starke rolled
over. The little man didn't have a chance with him. He was tough and
quick, but Starke's sheer size smothered him. Starke could remember
when Romna would not have seemed small to him. He hit the bard's jaw
with his fist. Romna's head cracked hard against the stone. He let go
of the knife. He seemed to be through fighting. Starke got up. He was
sweating, breathing heavily, not because of his exertion. His mouth was
glistening and eager, like a dog's. His muscles twitched, his belly was
hot and knotted with excitement. His yellow eyes had a strange look.</p>

<p>He went back to Beudag.</p>

<p>She lay on the black rock, on her back. Candlelight ran pale gold
across her brown skin, skirting the sharp strong hollows between her
breasts and under the arching rim of her rib-case. Starke knelt, across
her body, his weight pressed down against her harsh breathing. He
stared at her. Sweat stood out on his face. He took her throat between
his hands again.</p>

<p>He watched the blood grow dark in her checks. He watched the veins coil
on her forehead. He watched the redness blacken in her lips. She fought
a little, very vaguely, like someone moving in a dream. Starke breathed
hoarsely, animal-like, through an open mouth.</p>

<p>Then, gradually his body became rigid. His hands froze, not releasing
pressure, but not adding any. His yellow eyes widened. It was as though
he were trying to see Beudag's face and it was hidden in dense clouds.</p>

<p>Back of him, back in the tunnel, was the soft, faint whisper of sandals
on uneven rock. Sandals, walking slowly. Starke did not hear. Beudag's
face glimmered deep in a heavy mist below him, a blasphemy of a face,
distorted, blackened.</p>

<p>Starke's hands began to open.</p>

<p>They opened slowly. Muscles stood like coiled ropes in his arms and
shoulders, as though he moved them against heavy weights. His lips
peeled back from his teeth. He bent his neck, and sweat dropped from
his face and glittered on Beudag's breast.</p>

<p>Starke was now barely touching Beudag's neck. She began to breathe
again, painfully.</p>

<p>Starke began to laugh. It was not nice laughter. "Rann," he whispered.
"Rann, you she-devil." He half fell away from Beudag and stood up,
holding himself against the wall. He was shaking violently. "I wouldn't
use your hate for killing, so you tried to use my passion." He cursed
her in a flat sibilant whisper. He had never in his profane life really
cursed anyone before.</p>

<p>He heard an echo of laughter dancing in his brain.</p>

<p>Starke turned. Faolan of the Ships stood in the tunnel mouth. His head
was bent, listening, his blind dark eyes fixed on Starke as though he
saw him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Faolan said softly "I hear you, Starke. I hear the other breathing, but
they don't speak."</p>

<p>"They're all right. I didn't mean to do...."</p>

<p>Faolan smiled. He stepped out on the narrow ledge. He knew where he was
going, and his smile was not pleasant.</p>

<p>"I heard your steps in the passage beyond my room. I knew Beudag was
leading you, and where, and why. I would have been here sooner, but
it's a slow way in the dark."</p>

<p>The candle lay in his path. He felt the heat of it close to his leg,
and stopped and felt for it, and ground it out. It was dark, then. Very
dark, except for a faint smudgy glow from the scrap of ocean that lay
along the cave floor.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," Faolan said, "as long as I came in time."</p>

<p>Starke shifted his weight warily. "Faolan...."</p>

<p>"I wanted you alone. On this night of all nights I wanted you alone.
Beudag fights in my place now, Conan. My manhood needs proving."</p>

<p>Starke strained his eyes in the gloom, measuring the ledge, measuring
the place where the skiff was moored. He didn't want to fight Faolan.
In Faolan's place he would have felt the same. Starke understood
perfectly. He didn't hate Faolan, he didn't want to kill him, and he
was afraid of Rann's power over him when his emotions got control.
You couldn't keep a determined man from killing you and still be
uninvolved emotionally. Starke would be damned if he'd kill anyone to
suit Rann.</p>

<p>He moved, silently, trying to slip past Faolan on the outside and get
into the skiff. Faolan gave no sign of hearing him. Starke did not
breathe. His sandals came down lighter than snowflakes. Faolan did not
swerve. He would pass Starke with a foot to spare. They came abreast.</p>

<p>Faolan's hand shot out and caught in Starke's long black hair. The
blind man laughed softly and closed in.</p>

<p>Starke swung one from the floor. Do it the quickest way and get clear.
But Faolan was fast. He came in so swiftly that Starke's fist jarred
harmlessly along his ribs. He was bigger than Starke, and heavier, and
the darkness didn't bother him.</p>

<p>Starke bared his teeth. Do it quick, brother, and clear out! Or that
green-eyed she-cat.... Faolan's brute bulk weighed him down. Faolan's
arm crushed his neck. Faolan's fist was knocking his guts loose. Starke
got moving.</p>

<p>He'd fought in a lot of places. He'd learned from stokers and tramps,
Martian Low-Canalers, red-eyed Nahali in the running gutters of Lhi.
He didn't use his knife. He used his knees and feet and elbows and his
hands, fist and flat. It was a good fight. Faolan was a good fighter,
but Starke knew more tricks.</p>

<p>One more, Starke thought. One more and he's out. He drew back for it,
and his heel struck Romna, lying on the rock. He staggered, and Faolan
caught him with a clean swinging blow. Starke fell backward against the
cave wall. His head cracked the rock. Light flooded crimson across his
brain and then paled and grew cooler, a wash of clear silver-green like
water. He sank under it....</p>

<p>He was tired, desperately tired. His head ached. He wanted to rest, but
he could feel that he was sitting up, doing something that had to be
done. He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>He sat in the stern of a skiff. The long sweep was laid into its
crutch, held like a tiller bar against his body. The blade of the sweep
trailed astern in the red sea, and where the metal touched there was a
spurt of silver fire and a swirling of brilliant motes. The skiff moved
rapidly through the sullen fog, through a mist of blood in the hot
Venusian night.</p>

<p>Beudag crouched in the bow, facing Starke. She was bound securely with
strips of the white cloth she had worn. Bruises showed dark on her
throat. She was watching Starke with the intent, unwinking, perfectly
expressionless gaze of a tigress.</p>

<p>Starke looked away, down at himself. There was blood on his kilt, a
brown smear of it across his chest. It was not his blood. He drew the
knife slowly out of its sheath. The blade was dull and crusted, still a
little wet.</p>

<p>Starke looked at Beudag. His lips were stiff, swollen. He moistened
them and said hoarsely, "What happened?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, slowly, not speaking. Her eyes did not waver.</p>

<p>A black, cold rage took hold of Starke and shook him. Rann! He rose and
went forward, letting the sweep go where it would. He began to untie
Beudag's wrists.</p>

<p>A shape swam toward them out of the red mist. A longship with two heavy
sweeps bursting fire astern and a slender figurehead shaped like a
woman. A woman with hair and eyes of aquamarine. It came alongside the
skiff.</p>

<p>A rope ladder snaked down. Men lined the low rail. Slender men with
skin that glistened white like powdered snow, and hair the color of
distant shallows.</p>

<p>One of them said, "Come aboard, Hugh Starke."</p>

<p>Starke went back to the sweep. It bit into the sea, sending the skiff
in a swift arc away from Rann's ship.</p>

<p>Grapnels flew, hooking the skiff at thwart and gunwale. Bows appeared
in the hands of the men, wicked curving things with barbed metal shafts
on the string. The man said again, politely, "Come aboard."</p>

<p>Hugh Starke finished untying Beudag. He didn't speak. There seemed to
be nothing to say. He stood back while she climbed the ladder and then
followed. The skiff was cast loose. The longship veered away, gathering
speed.</p>

<p>Starke said, "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>The man smiled. "To Falga."</p>

<p>Starke nodded. He went below with Beudag into a cabin with soft couches
covered with spider-silk and panels of dark wood beautifully painted,
dim fantastic scenes from the past of Rann's people. They sat opposite
each other. They still did not speak.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They raised Falga in the opal dawn&mdash;a citadel of basalt cliffs rising
sheer from the burning sea, with a long arm holding a harbor full of
ships. There were green fields inland, and beyond, cloaked in the
eternal mists of Venus, the Mountains of White Clouds lifted spaceward.
Starke wished that he had never seen the Mountains of White Cloud.
Then, looking at his hands, lean and strong on his long thighs, he
wasn't so sure. He thought of Rann waiting for him. Anger, excitement,
a confused violence of emotion set him pacing nervously.</p>

<p>Beudag sat quietly, withdrawn, waiting.</p>

<p>The longship threaded the crowded moorings and slid into place
alongside a stone quay. Men rushed to make fast. They were human
men, as Starke judged humans, like Beudag and himself. They had the
shimmering silver hair and fair skin of the plateau peoples, the
fine-cut faces and straight bodies. They wore leather collars with
metal tags and they went naked like beasts, and they were gaunt and
bowed with labor. Here and there a man with pale blue-green hair and
resplendent harness stood godlike above the swarming masses.</p>

<p>Starke and Beudag went ashore. They might have been prisoners or
honored guests, surrounded by their escort from the ship. Streets ran
back from the harbor, twisting and climbing crazily up the cliffs.
Houses climbed on each others backs. It had begun to rain, the heavy
steaming downpour of Venus, and the moist heat brought out the choking
stench of people, too many people.</p>

<p>They climbed, ankle deep in water sweeping down the streets that were
half stairway. Thin naked children peered out of the houses, out of
narrow alleys. Twice they passed through market squares where women
with the blank faces of defeat drew back from stalls of coarse food to
let the party through.</p>

<p>There was something wrong. After a while Starke realized it was the
silence. In all that horde of humanity no one laughed, or sang, or
shouted. Even the children never spoke above a whisper. Starke began to
feel a little sick. Their eyes had a look in them....</p>

<p>He glanced at Beudag, and away again.</p>

<p>The waterfront streets ended in a sheer basalt face honeycombed with
galleries. Starke's party entered them, still climbing. They passed
level after level of huge caverns, open to the sea. There was the
same crowding, the same stench, the same silence. Eyes glinted in the
half-light, bare feet moved furtively on stone. Somewhere a baby cried
thinly, and was hushed at once.</p>

<p>They came out on the cliff top, into the clean high air. There was a
city here. Broad streets, lined with trees, low rambling villas of the
black rock set in walled gardens, drowned in brilliant vines and giant
ferns and flowers. Naked men and women worked in the gardens, or hauled
carts of rubbish through the alleys, or hurried on errands, slipping
furtively across the main streets where they intersected the mews.</p>

<p>The party turned away from the sea, heading toward an ebon palace that
sat like a crown above the city. The steaming rain beat on Starke's
bare body, and up here you could get the smell of the rain, even
through the heavy perfume of the flowers. You could smell Venus in the
rain&mdash;musky and primitive and savagely alive, a fecund giantess with
passion flowers in her outstretched hands. Starke set his feet down
like a panther and his eyes burned a smoky amber.</p>

<p>They entered the palace of Rann....</p>

<p>She received them in the same apartment where Starke had come to after
the crash. Through a broad archway he could see the high bed where his
old body had lain before the life went out of it. The red sea steamed
under the rain outside, the rusty fog coiling languidly through the
open arches of the gallery. Rann watched them lazily from a raised
couch set massively into the wall. Her long sparkling legs sprawled
arrogantly across the black spider-silk draperies. This time her tabard
was a pale yellow. Her eyes were still the color of shoal-water, still
amused, still secret, still dangerous.</p>

<p>Starke said, "So you made me do it after all."</p>

<p>"And you're angry." She laughed, her teeth showing white and pointed as
bone needles. Her gaze held Starke's. There was nothing casual about
it. Starke's hawk eyes turned molten yellow, like hot gold, and did not
waver.</p>

<p>Beudag stood like a bronze spear, her forearms crossed beneath her bare
sharp breasts. Two of Rann's palace guards stood behind her.</p>

<p>Starke began to walk toward Rann.</p>

<p>She watched him come. She let him get close enough to reach out and
touch her, and then she said slyly, "It's a good body, isn't it?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starke looked at her for a moment. Then he laughed. He threw back his
head and roared, and struck the great corded muscles of his belly with
his fist. Presently he looked straight into Rann's eyes and said:</p>

<p>"I know you."</p>

<p>She nodded. "We know each other. Sit down, Hugh Starke." She swung her
long legs over to make room, half erect now, looking at Beudag. Starke
sat down. He did not look at Beudag.</p>

<p>Rann said, "Will your people surrender now?"</p>

<p>Beudag did not move, not even her eyelids. "If Faolan is dead&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And if he's not?"</p>

<p>Beudag stiffened. Starke did too.</p>

<p>"Then," said Beudag quietly, "they'll wait."</p>

<p>"Until he is?"</p>

<p>"Or until they must surrender."</p>

<p>Rann nodded. To the guards she said, "See that this woman is well fed
and well treated."</p>

<p>Beudag and her escort had turned to go when Starke said, "Wait." The
guards looked at Rann, who nodded, and glanced quizzically at Starke.
Starke said:</p>

<p>"Is Faolan dead?"</p>

<p>Rann hesitated. Then she smiled. "No. You have the most damnably tough
mind, Starke. You struck deep, but not deep enough. He may still die,
but.... No, he's not dead." She turned to Beudag and said with easy
mockery, "You needn't hold anger against Starke. I'm the one who should
be angry." Her eyes came back to Starke. They didn't look angry.</p>

<p>Starke said, "There's something else. Conan&mdash;the Conan that used to
be, before Falga."</p>

<p>"Beudag's Conan."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Why did he betray his people?"</p>

<p>Rann studied him. Her strange pale lips curved, her sharp white teeth
glistening wickedly with barbed humor. Then she turned to Beudag.
Beudag was still standing like a carved image, but her smooth muscles
were ridged with tension, and her eyes were not the eyes of an image.</p>

<p>"Conan or Starke," said Rann, "she's still Beudag, isn't she? All
right, I'll tell you. Conan betrayed his people because I put it into
his mind to do it. He fought me. He made a good fight of it. But he
wasn't quite as tough as you are, Starke."</p>

<p>There was a silence. For the first time since entering the room, Hugh
Starke looked at Beudag. After a moment she sighed and lifted her chin
and smiled, a deep, faint smile. The guards walked out beside her, but
she was more erect and lighter of step than either of them.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rann, when they were gone, "and what about you,
Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan."</p>

<p>"Have I any choice?"</p>

<p>"I always keep my bargains."</p>

<p>"Then give me my dough and let me clear the hell out of here."</p>

<p>"Sure that's what you want?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want."</p>

<p>"You could stay a while, you know."</p>

<p>"With you."</p>

<p>Rann lifted her frosty-white shoulders. "I'm not promising half my
kingdom, or even part of it. But you might be amused."</p>

<p>"I got no sense of humor."</p>

<p>"Don't you even want to see what happens to Crom Dhu?"</p>

<p>Starke got up. He said savagely, "The hell with Crom Dhu."</p>

<p>"And Beudag."</p>

<p>"And Beudag." He stopped, then fixed Rann with uncompromising yellow
eyes. "No. Not Beudag. What are you going to do to her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Don't give me that."</p>

<p>"I say again, nothing. Whatever is done, her own people will do."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that little Dagger-in-the-Sheath will be rested, cared for, and
fattened, for a few days. Then I shall take her aboard my own ship and
join the fleet before Crom Dhu. Beudag will be made quite comfortable
at the masthead, where her people can see her plainly. She will stay
there until the Rock surrenders. It depends on her own people how long
she stays. She'll be given water. Not much, but enough."</p>

<p>Starke stared at her. He stared at her a long time. Then he spat
deliberately on the floor and said in a perfectly flat voice: "How soon
can I get out of here?"</p>

<p>Rann laughed, a small casual chuckle. "Humans," she said, "are so
damned queer. I don't think I'll ever understand them." She reached out
and struck a gong that stood in a carved frame beside the couch. The
soft deep shimmering note had a sad quality of nostalgia. Rann lay back
against the silken cushions and sighed.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Hugh Starke."</p>

<p>A pause. Then, regretfully:</p>

<p>"Goodbye&mdash;Conan!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They had made good time along the rim of the Red Sea. One of Rann's
galleys had taken them to the edge of the Southern Ocean and left them
on a narrow shingle beach under the cliffs. From there they had climbed
to the rimrock and gone on foot&mdash;Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan and four of
Rann's arrogant shining men. They were supposed to be guide and escort.
They were courteous, and they kept pace uncomplainingly though Starke
marched as though the devil were pricking his heels. But they were
armed, and Starke was not.</p>

<p>Sometimes, very faintly. Starke was aware of Rann's mind touching his
with the velvet delicacy of a cat's paw. Sometimes he started out of
his sleep with her image sharp in his mind, her lips touched with the
mocking, secret smile. He didn't like that. He didn't like it at all.</p>

<p>But he liked even less the picture that stayed with him waking or
sleeping. The picture he wouldn't look at. The picture of a tall woman
with hair like loose fire on her neck, walking on light proud feet
between her guards.</p>

<p>She'll be given water, Rann said. Not much, but enough.</p>

<p>Starke gripped the solid squareness of the box that held his million
credits and set the miles reeling backward from under his sandals.</p>

<p>On the fifth night one of Rann's men spoke quietly across the campfire.
"Tomorrow," he said, "we'll reach the pass."</p>

<p>Starke got up and went away by himself, to the edge of the rimrock that
fell sheer to the burning sea. He sat down. The red fog wrapped him
like a mist of blood. He thought of the blood on Beudag's breast the
first time he saw her. He thought of the blood on his knife, crusted
and dried. He thought of the blood poured rank and smoking into the
gutters of Crom Dhu. The fog has to be red, he thought. Of all the
goddam colors in the universe, it has to be red. Red like Beudag's hair.</p>

<p>He held out his hands and looked at them, because he could still feel
the silken warmth of that hair against his skin. There was nothing
there now but the old white scars of another man's battles.</p>

<p>He set his fists against his temples and wished for his old body back
again&mdash;the little stunted abortion that had clawed and scratched its
way to survival through sheer force of mind. A most damnably tough
mind, Rann had said. Yeah. It had had to be tough. But a mind was a
mind. It didn't have emotions. It just figured out something coldly
and then went ahead and never questioned, and it controlled the body
utterly, because the body was only the worthless machinery that carried
the mind around. Worthless. Yeah. The few women he'd ever looked at
had told him that&mdash;and he hadn't even minded much. The old body hadn't
given him any trouble.</p>

<p>He was having trouble now.</p>

<p>Starke got up and walked.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we reach the pass.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we go away from the Red Sea. There are nine planets and the
whole damn Belt. There are women on all of them. All shapes, colors,
and sizes, human, semi-human, and God knows what. With a million
credits a guy could buy half of them, and with Conan's body he could
buy the rest. What's a woman, anyway? Only a....</p>

<p><i>Water. She'll be given water. Not much, but enough.</i></p>

<p>Conan reached out and took hold of a spire of rock, and his muscles
stood out like knotted ropes. "Oh God," he whispered, "what's the
matter with me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Love.</i>"</p>

<p>It wasn't God who answered. It was Rann. He saw her plainly in his
mind, heard her voice like a silver bell.</p>

<p>"Conan was a man, Hugh Starke. He was whole, body and heart and brain.
He knew how to love, and with him it wasn't women, but one woman&mdash;and
her name was Beudag. I broke him, but it wasn't easy. I can't break
you."</p>

<p>Starke stood for a long, long time. He did not move, except that he
trembled. Then he took from his belt the box containing his million
credits and threw it out as far as he could over the cliff edge. The
red mist swallowed it up. He did not hear it strike the surface of the
sea. Perhaps in that sea there was no splashing. He did not wait to
find out.</p>

<p>He turned back along the rimrock, toward a place where he remembered
a cleft, or chimney, leading down. And the four shining men who wore
Rann's harness came silently out of the heavy luminous night and ringed
him in. Their sword-points caught sharp red glimmers from the sky.</p>

<p>Starke had nothing on him but a kilt and sandals, and a cloak of
tight-woven spider-silk that shed the rain.</p>

<p>"Rann sent you?" he said.</p>

<p>The men nodded.</p>

<p>"To kill me?"</p>

<p>Again they nodded. The blood drained out of Starke's face, leaving it
grey and stony under the bronze. His hand went to his throat, over the
gold fastening of his cloak.</p>

<p>The four men closed in like dancers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starke loosed his cloak and swung it like a whip across their faces. It
confused them for a second, for a heartbeat&mdash;no more, but long enough.
Starke left two of them to tangle their blades in the heavy fabric and
leaped aside. A sharp edge slipped and turned along his ribs, and then
he had reached in low and caught a man around the ankles, and used the
thrashing body for a flail.</p>

<p>The body was strangely light, as though the bones in it were no more
than rigid membrane, like a fish.</p>

<p>If he had stayed to fight, they would have finished him in seconds.
They were fighting men, and quick. But Starke didn't stay. He gained
his moment's grace and used it. They were hard on his heels, their
points all but pricking his back as he ran, but he made it. Along the
rimrock, out along a narrow tongue that jutted over the sea, and then
outward, far outward, into red fog and dim fire that rolled around his
plummeting body.</p>

<p>Oh God, he thought, if I guessed wrong and there <i>is</i> a beach....</p>

<p>The breath tore out of his lungs. His ears cracked, went dead. He held
his arms out beyond his head, the thumbs locked together, his neck
braced forward against the terrific upward push. He struck the surface
of the sea.</p>

<p>There was no splash.</p>

<p>Dim coiling fire that drifted with infinite laziness around him,
caressing his body with slow, tingling sparks. A feeling of lightness,
as though his flesh had become one with the drifting fire. A sense
of suffocation that had no basis in fact and gave way gradually to
a strange exhilaration. There was no shock of impact, no crushing
pressure. Merely a cushioning softness, like dropping into a bed of
compressed air. Starke felt himself turning end over end, pinwheel
fashion, and then that stopped, so that he sank quietly and without
haste to the bottom.</p>

<p>Or rather, into the crystalline upper reaches of what seemed to be a
forest.</p>

<p>He could see it spreading away along the downward-sloping floor of the
ocean, into the vague red shadows of distance. Slender fantastic trunks
upholding a maze of delicate shining branches, without leaves or fruit.
They were like trees exquisitely molded from ice, transparent, holding
the lambent shifting fire of the strange sea. Starke didn't think they
were, or ever had been, alive. More like coral, he thought, or some
vagary of mineral deposit. Beautiful, though. Like something you'd see
in a dream. Beautiful, silent, and somehow deadly.</p>

<p>He couldn't explain that feeling of deadliness. Nothing moved in
the red drifts between the trunks. It was nothing about the trees
themselves. It was just something he sensed.</p>

<p>He began to move among the upper branches, following the downward drop
of the slope.</p>

<p>He found that he could swim quite easily. Or perhaps it was more like
flying. The dense gas buoyed him up, almost balancing the weight of
his body, so that it was easy to swoop along, catching a crystal branch
and using it as a lever to throw himself forward to the next one.</p>

<p>He went deeper and deeper into the heart of the forbidden Southern
Ocean. Nothing stirred. The fairy forest stretched limitless ahead. And
Starke was afraid.</p>

<p>Rann came into his mind abruptly. Her face, clearly outlined, was full
of mockery.</p>

<p>"I'm going to watch you die, Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan. But before you
die, I'll show you something. Look."</p>

<p>Her face dimmed, and in its place was Crom Dhu rising bleak into the
red fog, the longships broken and sunk in the harbor, and Rann's fleet
around it in a shining circle.</p>

<p>One ship in particular. The flagship. The vision in Starke's mind
rushed toward it, narrowed down to the masthead platform. To the woman
who stood there, naked, erect, her body lashed tight with thin cruel
cords.</p>

<p>A woman with red hair blowing in the slow wind, and blue eyes that
looked straight ahead like a falcon's, at Crom Dhu.</p>

<p>Beudag.</p>

<p>Rann's laughter ran across the picture and blurred it like a ripple of
ice-cold water.</p>

<p>"You'd have done better," she said, "to take the clean steel when I
offered it to you."</p>

<p>She was gone, and Starke's mind was as empty and cold as the mind of a
corpse. He found that he was standing still, clinging to a branch, his
face upturned as though by some blind instinct, his sight blurred.</p>

<p>He had never cried before in all his life, nor prayed.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as time, down there in the smoky shadows of the
sea bottom. It might have been minutes or hours later that Hugh Starke
discovered he was being hunted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were three of them, slipping easily among the shining branches.
They were pale golden, almost phosphorescent, about the size of large
hounds. Their eyes were huge, jewel-like in their slim sharp faces.
They possessed four members that might have been legs and arms,
retracted now against their arrowing bodies. Golden membranes spread
wing-like from head to flank, and they moved like wings, balancing
expertly the thrust of the flat, powerful tails.</p>

<p>They could have closed in on him easily, but they didn't seem to be
in any hurry. Starke had sense enough not to wear himself out trying
to get away. He kept on going, watching them. He discovered that the
crystal branches could be broken, and he selected himself one with
a sharp forked tip, shoving it swordwise under his belt. He didn't
suppose it would do much good, but it made him feel better.</p>

<p>He wondered why the things didn't jump him and get it over with. They
looked hungry enough, the way they were showing him their teeth.
But they kept about the same distance away, in a sort of crescent
formation, and every so often the ones on the outside would make a
tentative dart at him, then fall back as he swerved away. It wasn't
like being hunted so much as....</p>

<p>Starke's eyes narrowed. He began suddenly to feel much more afraid than
he had before, and he wouldn't have believed that possible.</p>

<p>The things weren't hunting him at all. They were herding him.</p>

<p>There was nothing he could do about it. He tried stopping, and they
swooped in and snapped at him, working expertly together so that while
he was trying to stab one of them with his clumsy weapon, the others
were worrying his heels like sheepdogs at a recalcitrant wether.</p>

<p>Starke, like the wether, bowed to the inevitable and went where he was
driven. The golden hounds showed their teeth in animal laughter and
sniffed hungrily at the thread of blood he left behind him in the slow
red coils of fire.</p>

<p>After a while he heard the music.</p>

<p>It seemed to be some sort of a harp, with a strange quality of
vibration in the notes. It wasn't like anything he'd ever heard before.
Perhaps the gas of which the sea was composed was an extraordinarily
good conductor of sound, with a property of diffusion that made the
music seem to come from everywhere at once&mdash;softly at first, like
something touched upon in a dream, and then, as he drew closer to the
source, swelling into a racing, rippling flood of melody that wrapped
itself around his nerves with a demoniac shiver of ecstasy.</p>

<p>The golden hounds began to fret with excitement, spreading their
shining wings, driving him impatiently faster through the crystal
branches.</p>

<p>Starke could feel the vibration growing in him&mdash;the very fibres of his
muscles shuddering in sympathy with the unearthly harp. He guessed
there was a lot of the music he couldn't hear. Too high, too low for
his ears to register. But he could feel it.</p>

<p>He began to go faster, not because of the hounds, but because he wanted
to. The deep quivering in his flesh excited him. He began to breathe
harder, partly because of increased exertion, and some chemical quality
of the mixture he breathed made him slightly drunk.</p>

<p>The thrumming harp-song stroked and stung him, waking a deeper, darker
music, and suddenly he saw Beudag clearly&mdash;half-veiled and mystic in
the candle light at Faolan's dun; smooth curving bronze, her hair loose
fire about her throat. A great stab of agony went through him. He
called her name, once, and the harp-song swept it up and away, and then
suddenly there was no music any more, and no forest, and nothing but
cold embers in Starke's heart.</p>

<p>He could see everything quite clearly in the time it took him to float
from the top of the last tree to the floor of the plain. He had no idea
how long a time that was. It didn't matter. It was one of those moments
when time doesn't have any meaning.</p>

<p>The rim of the forest fell away in a long curve that melted glistening
into the spark-shot sea. From it the plain stretched out, a level
glassy floor of black obsidian, the spew of some long-dead volcano. Or
was it dead? It seemed to Starke that the light here was redder, more
vital, as though he were close to the source from which it sprang.</p>

<p>As he looked farther over the plain, the light seemed to coalesce
into a shimmering curtain that wavered like the heat veils that
dance along the Mercurian Twilight Belt at high noon. For one brief
instant he glimpsed a picture on the curtain&mdash;a city, black, shining,
fantastically turreted, the gigantic reflection of a Titan's dream.
Then it was gone, and the immediate menace of the foreground took all
of Starke's attention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He saw the flock, herded by more of the golden hounds. And he saw the
shepherd, with the harp held silent between his hands.</p>

<p>The flock moved sluggishly, phosphorescently.</p>

<p>One hundred, two hundred silent, limply floating warriors drifting down
the red dimness. In pairs, singly, or in pallid clusters they came. The
golden hounds winged silently, leisurely around them, channeling them
in tides that sluiced toward the fantastic ebon city.</p>

<p>The shepherd stood, a crop of obsidian, turning his shark-pale face.
His sharp, aquamarine eyes found Starke. His silvery hand leapt
beckoning over hard-threads, striking them a blow. Reverberations ran
out, seized Starke, shook him. He dropped his crystal dagger.</p>

<p>Hot screens of fire exploded in his eyes, bubbles whirled and danced in
his eardrums. He lost all muscular control. His dark head fell forward
against the thick blackness of hair on his chest; his golden eyes
dissolved into weak, inane yellow, and his mouth loosened. He wanted to
fight, but it was useless. This shepherd was one of the sea-people he
had come to see, and one way or another he would see him.</p>

<p>Dark blood filled his aching eyes. He felt himself led, nudged, forced
first this way, then that. A golden hound slipped by, gave him a
pressure which roiled him over into a current of sea-blood. It ran down
past where the shepherd stood with only a harp for a weapon.</p>

<p>Starke wondered dimly whether these other warriors in the flock,
drifting, were dead or alive like himself. He had another surprise
coming.</p>

<p>They were all Rann's men. Men of Falga. Silver men with burning green
hair. Rann's men. One of them, a huge warrior colored like powdered
salt, wandered aimlessly by on another tide, his green eyes dull. He
looked dead.</p>

<p>What business had the sea-people with the dead warriors of Falga? Why
the hounds and the shepherd's harp? Questions eddied like lifted silt
in Starke's tired, hanging head. Eddied and settled flat.</p>

<p>Starke joined the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The hounds with deft flickerings of wings, ushered him into the midst
of the flock. Bodies brushed against him. <i>Cold</i> bodies. He wanted to
cry out. The cords of his neck constricted. In his mind the cry went
forward:</p>

<p>"Are you alive, men of Falga?"</p>

<p>No answer; but the drift of scarred, pale bodies. The eyes in them knew
nothing. They had forgotten Falga. They had forgotten Rann for whom
they had lifted blade. Their tongues lolling in mouths asked nothing
but sleep. They were getting it.</p>

<p>A hundred, two hundred strong they made a strange human river slipping
toward the gigantic city wall. Starke-called-Conan and his bitter
enemies going together. From the corners of his eyes, Starke saw the
shepherd move. The shepherd was like Rann and her people who had years
ago abandoned the sea to live on land. The shepherd seemed colder, more
fish-like, though. There were small translucent webs between the thin
fingers and spanning the long-toed feet. Thin, scar-like gills in the
shadow of his tapered chin, lifted and sealed in the current, eating,
taking sustenance from the blood-colored sea.</p>

<p>The harp spoke and the golden hounds obeyed. The harp spoke and the
bodies twisted uneasily, as in a troubled sleep. A triple chord of it
came straight at Starke. His fingers clenched.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and the dead shall walk again&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another ironic ripple of music.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and Rann's men will rise again, this time against her&mdash;"</p>

<p>Starke had time to feel a brief, bewildered shivering, before the
current hurled him forward. Clamoring drunkenly, witlessly, all about
him, the dead, muscleless warriors of Falga, tried to crush past him,
all of them at once....</p>

<p>Long ago some vast sea Titan had dreamed of avenues struck from black
stone. Each stone the size of three men tall. There had been a dream
of walls going up and up until they dissolved into scarlet mist. There
had been another dream of sea-gardens in which fish hung like erotic
flowers, on tendrils of sensitive film-tissue. Whole beds of fish clung
to garden base, like colonies of flowers aglow with sunlight. And on
occasion a black amoebic presence filtered by, playing the gardener,
weeding out an amber flower here, an amythystine bloom there.</p>

<p>And the sea Titan had dreamed of endless balustrades and battlements,
of windowless turrets where creatures swayed like radium-skinned
phantoms, carrying their green plumes of hair in their lifted palms
and looked down with curious, insolent eyes from on high. Women with
shimmering bodies like some incredible coral harvested and kept high
over these black stone streets, each in its archway.</p>

<p>Starke was alone. Falga's warriors had gone off along a dim
subterranean vent, vanished. Now the faint beckoning of harp and the
golden hounds behind him, turned him down a passage that opened out
into a large circular stone room, one end of which opened out into a
hall. Around the ebon ceiling, slender schools of fish swam. It was
their bright effulgence that gave light to the room. They had been
there, breeding, eating, dying, a thousand years, giving light to the
place, and they would be there, breeding and dying, a thousand more.</p>

<p>The harp faded until it was only a murmur.</p>

<p>Starke found his feet. Strength returned to him. He was able to see the
man in the center of the room well. Too well.</p>

<p>The man hung in the fire tide. Chains of wrought bronze held his thin
fleshless ankles so he couldn't escape. His body desired it. It floated
up.</p>

<p>It had been dead a long time. It was gaseous with decomposition and
it wanted to rise to the surface of the Red Sea. The chains prevented
this. Its arms weaved like white scarves before a sunken white face.
Black hair trembled on end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was one of Faolan's men. One of the Rovers. One of those who had
gone down at Falga because of Conan.</p>

<p>His name was Geil.</p>

<p>Starke remembered.</p>

<p>The part of him that was Conan remembered the name.</p>

<p>The dead lips moved.</p>

<p>"Conan. What luck is this! Conan. I make you welcome."</p>

<p>The words were cruel, the lips around them loose and dead. It seemed to
Starke an anger and embittered wrath lay deep in those hollow eyes. The
lips twitched again.</p>

<p>"I went down at Falga for you and Rann, Conan. Remember?"</p>

<p>Part of Starke remembered and twisted in agony.</p>

<p>"We're all here, Conan. All of us. Clev and Mannt and Bron and Aesur.
Remember Aesur, who could shape metal over his spine, prying it with
his fingers? Aesur is here, big as a sea-monster, waiting in a niche,
cold and loose as string. The sea-shepherds collected us. Collected us
for a purpose of irony. Look!"</p>

<p>The boneless fingers hung out, as in a wind, pointing.</p>

<p>Starke turned slowly, and his heart pounded an uneven, shattering drum
beat. His jaw clinched and his eyes blurred. That part of him that
was Conan cried out. Conan was so much of him and he so much of Conan
it was impossible for a cleavage. They'd grown together like pearl
material around sand-specule, layer on layer. Starke cried out.</p>

<p>In the hall which this circular room overlooked, stood a thousand men.</p>

<p>In lines of fifty across, shoulder to shoulder, the men of Crom Dhu
stared unseeingly up at Starke. Here and there a face became shockingly
familiar. Old memory cried their names.</p>

<p>"Bron! Clev! Mannt! Aesur!"</p>

<p>The collected decomposition of their bodily fluids raised them, drifted
them above the flaggings. Each of them was chained, like Geil.</p>

<p>Geil whispered. "We have made a union with the men of Falga!"</p>

<p>Starke pulled back.</p>

<p>"Falga!"</p>

<p>"In death, all men are equals." He took his time with it. He was in no
hurry. Dead bodies under-sea are never in a hurry. They sort of bump
and drift and bide their time. "The dead serve those who give them a
semblance of life. Tomorrow we march against Crom Dhu."</p>

<p>"You're crazy! Crom Dhu is <i>your</i> home! It's the place of Beudag and
Faolan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" interrupted the hanging corpse, quietly, "Conan? Eh?" He
laughed. A crystal dribble of bubbles ran up from the slack mouth.
"Especially Conan. Conan who sank us at Falga...."</p>

<p>Starke moved swiftly. Nobody stopped him. He had the corpse's short
blade in an instant. Geil's chest made a cold, silent sheathe for it.
The blade went like a fork through butter.</p>

<p>Coldly, without noticing this, Geil's voice spoke out:</p>

<p>"Stab me, cut me. You can't kill me any deader. Make sections of me.
Play butcher. A flank, a hand, a heart! And while you're at it, I'll
tell you the plan."</p>

<p>Snarling, Starke seized the blade out again. With blind violence he
gave sharp blow after blow at the body, cursing bitterly, and the body
took each blow, rocking in the red tide a little, and said with a
matter-of-fact tone:</p>

<p>"We'll march out of the sea to Crom Dhu's gates. Romna and the others,
looking down, recognizing us, will have the gates thrown wide to
welcome us." The head tilted lazily, the lips peeled wide and folded
down languidly over the words. "Think of the elation, Conan! The moment
when Bron and Mannt and Aesur and I and yourself, yes, even yourself,
Conan, return to Crom Dhu!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starke saw it, vividly. Saw it like a tapestry woven for him. He stood
back, gasping for breath, his nostrils flaring, seeing what his blade
had done to Geil's body, and seeing the great stone gates of Crom Dhu
crashing open. The deliberation. The happiness, the elation to Faolan
and Romna to see old friends returned. Old Rovers, long thought dead.
Alive again, come to help! It made a picture!</p>

<p>With great deliberation, Starke struck flat across before him.</p>

<p>Geil's head, severed from its lazy body, began, with infinite
tiredness, to float toward the ceiling. As it traveled upward, now
facing, now bobbling the back of its skull toward Starke, it finished
its nightmare speaking:</p>

<p>"And then, once inside the gates, what then, Conan? Can you guess? Can
you guess what we'll do, Conan?"</p>

<p>Starke stared at nothingness, the sword trembling in his fist. From far
away he heard Geil's voice:</p>

<p>"&mdash;we will kill Faolan in his hall. He will die with surprised lips.
Romna's harp will lie in his disemboweled stomach. His heart with its
last pulsings will sound the strings. And as for Beudag&mdash;"</p>

<p>Starke tried to push the thoughts away, raging and helpless. Geil's
body was no longer anything to look at. He had done all he could to
it. Starke's face was bleached white and scraped down to the insane
bone of it, "You'd kill your own people!"</p>

<p>Geil's separated head lingered at the ceiling, light-fish illuminating
its ghastly features. "Our people? But we have no people! We're another
race now. The dead. We do the biddings of the sea-shepherds."</p>

<p>Starke looked out into the hall, then he looked at the circular wall.</p>

<p>"Okay," he said, without tone in his voice. "Come out. Where ever
you're hiding and using this voice-throwing act. Come on out and talk
straight."</p>

<p>In answer, an entire section of ebon stones fell back on silent
hingework. Starke saw a long slender black marble table. Six people sat
behind it in carven midnight thrones.</p>

<p>They were all men. Naked except for film-like garments about their
loins. They looked at Starke with no particular hatred or curiosity.
One of them cradled a harp. It was the shepherd who'd drawn Starke
through the gate. Amusedly, his webbed fingers lay on the strings, now
and then bringing out a clear sound from one of the two hundred strands.</p>

<p>The shepherd stopped Starke's rush forward with a cry of that harp!</p>

<p>The blade in his hand was red hot. He dropped it.</p>

<p>The shepherd put a head on the story. "And then? And then we will march
Rann's dead warriors all the way to Falga. There, Rann's people, seeing
the warriors, will be overjoyed, hysterical to find their friends and
relatives returned. They, too, will fling wide Falga's defenses. And
death will walk in, disguised as resurrection."</p>

<p>Starke nodded, slowly, wiping his hand across his cheek. "Back on Earth
we call that psychology. <i>Good</i> psychology. But will it fool Rann?"</p>

<p>"Rann will be with her ships at Crom Dhu. While she's gone, the
innocent population will let in their lost warriors gladly." The
shepherd had amused green eyes. He looked like a youth of some
seventeen years. Deceptively young. If Starke guessed right, the youth
was nearer to two centuries old. That's how you lived and looked when
you were under the Red Sea. Something about the emanations of it kept
part of you young.</p>

<p>Starke lidded his yellow hawks' eyes thoughtfully. "You've got all
aces. You'll win. But what's Crom Dhu to you? Why not just Rann? She's
one of you, you hate her more than you do the Rovers. Her ancestors
came up on land, you never got over hating them for that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shepherd shrugged. "Toward Crom Dhu we have little actual hatred.
Except that they are by nature land-men, even if they do rove by boat,
and pillagers. One day they might try their luck on the sunken devices
of this city."</p>

<p>Starke put a hand out. "We're fighting Rann, too. Don't forget, we're
on your side!"</p>

<p>"Whereas we are on no one's," retorted the green-haired youth, "Except
our own. Welcome to the army which will attack Crom Dhu."</p>

<p>"Me! By the gods, over my dead body!"</p>

<p>"That," said the youth, amusedly, "is what we intend. We've worked many
years, you see, to perfect the plan. We're not much good out on land.
We needed bodies that could do the work for us. So, every time Faolan
lost a ship or Rann lost a ship, we were there, with our golden hounds,
waiting. Collecting. Saving. Waiting until we had enough of each side's
warriors. They'll do the fighting for us. Oh, not for long, of course.
The Source energy will give them a semblance of life, a momentary
electrical ability of walk and combat, but once out of water they'll
last only half an hour. But that should be time enough once the gates
of Crom Dhu and Falga are open."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starke said, "Rann will find some way around you. Get her first. Attack
Crom Dhu the following day."</p>

<p>The youth deliberated. "You're stalling. But there's sense in it. Rann
is most important. We'll get Falga first, then. You'll have a bit of
time in which to raise false hopes."</p>

<p>Starke began to get sick again. The room swam.</p>

<p>Very quietly, very easily, Rann came into his mind again. He felt her
glide in like the merest touch of a sea fern weaving in a tide pool.</p>

<p>He closed his mind down, but not before she snatched at a shred of
thought. Her aquamarine eyes reflected desire and inquiry.</p>

<p>"Hugh Starke, you're with the sea people?"</p>

<p>Her voice was soft. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Hugh Starke. How are you plotting against Falga?"</p>

<p>He said nothing. He thought nothing. He shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Her fingernails glittered, raking at his mind. "Tell me!"</p>

<p>His thoughts rolled tightly into a metal sphere which nothing could
dent.</p>

<p>Rann laughed unpleasantly and leaned forward until she filled every
dark horizon of his skull with her shimmering body. "All right. I
<i>gave</i> you Conan's body. Now I'll take it away."</p>

<p>She struck him a combined blow of her eyes, her writhing lips, her
bone-sharp teeth. "Go back to your old body, go back to your old body,
Hugh Starke," she hissed. "Go back! Leave Conan to his idiocy. Go back
to your old body!"</p>

<p>Fear had him. He fell down upon his face, quivering and jerking. You
could fight a man with a sword. But how could you fight this thing in
your brain? He began to suck sobbing breaths through his lips. He was
screaming. He could not hear himself. Her voice rushed in from the dim
outer red universe, destroying him.</p>

<p>"Hugh Starke! Go back to your old body!"</p>

<p>His old body was&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>And she was sending him back into it.</p>

<p>Part of him shot endwise through red fog.</p>

<p>He lay on a mountain plateau overlooking the harbor of Falga.</p>

<p>Red fog coiled and snaked around him. Flame birds dived eerily down at
his staring, blind eyes.</p>

<p>His old body held him.</p>

<p>Putrefaction stuffed his nostrils. The flesh sagged and slipped
greasily on his loosened structure. He felt small again and ugly. Flame
birds nibbled, picking, choosing between his ribs. Pain gorged him.
Cold, blackness, nothingness filled him. Back in his old body. Forever.</p>

<p>He didn't want that.</p>

<p>The plateau, the red fog vanished. The flame birds, too.</p>

<p>He lay once more on the floor of the sea shepherds, struggling.</p>

<p>"That was just a start," Rann told him. "Next time, I'll leave you up
there on the plateau in that body. <i>Now</i>, will you tell the plans of
the sea people? And go on living in Conan? He's yours, if you tell."
She smirked. "You don't want to be dead."</p>

<p>Starke tried to reason it out. Any way he turned was the wrong way. He
grunted out a breath. "If I tell, you'll still kill Beudag."</p>

<p>"Her life in exchange for what you know, Hugh Starke."</p>

<p>Her answer was too swift. It had the sound of treachery. Starke did not
believe. He would die. That would solve it. Then, at least, Rann would
die when the sea people carried out their strategy. That much revenge,
at least, damn it.</p>

<p>Then he got the idea.</p>

<p>He coughed out a laugh, raised his weak head to look at the startled
sea shepherd. His little dialogue with Rann had taken about ten
seconds, actually, but it had seemed a century. The sea shepherd
stepped forward.</p>

<p>Starke tried to get to his feet. "Got&mdash;got a proposition for you. You
with the harp. Rann's inside me. <i>Now.</i> Unless you guarantee Crom Dhu
and Beudag's safety, I'll tell her some things she might want to be in
on!"</p>

<p>The sea shepherd drew a knife.</p>

<p>Starke shook his head, coldly. "Put it away. Even if you get me I'll
give the whole damned strategy to Rann."</p>

<p>The shepherd dropped his hand. He was no fool.</p>

<p>Rann tore at Starke's brain. "Tell me! Tell me their plan!"</p>

<p>He felt like a guy in a revolving door. Starke got the sea men in
focus. He saw that they were afraid now, doubtful and nervous. "I'll be
dead in a minute," said Starke. "Promise me the safety of Crom Dhu and
I'll die without telling Rann a thing."</p>

<p>The sea shepherd hesitated, then raised his palm upward. "I promise,"
he said. "Crom Dhu will go untouched."</p>

<p>Starke sighed. He let his head fall forward until it hit the floor.
Then he rolled over, put his hands over his eyes. "It's a deal. Go give
Rann hell for me, will you, boys? Give her hell!"</p>

<p>As he drifted into mind darkness, Rann waited for him. Feebly, he told
her. "Okay, duchess. You'd kill me even if I'd told you the idea. I'm
ready. Try your god-awfullest to shove me back into that stinking body
of mine. I'll fight you all the way there!"</p>

<p>Rann screamed. It was a pretty frustrated scream. Then the pains began.
She did a lot of work on his mind in the next minute.</p>

<p>That part of him that was Conan held on like a clam holding to its
precious contents.</p>

<p>The odor of putrid flesh returned. The blood mist returned. The flame
birds fell down at him in spirals of sparks and blistering smoke, to
winnow his naked ribs.</p>

<p>Starke spoke one last word before the blackness took him.</p>

<p>"Beudag."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He never expected to awaken again.</p>

<p>He awoke just the same.</p>

<p>There was red sea all around him. He lay on a kind of stone bed, and
the young sea shepherd sat beside him, looking down at him, smiling
delicately.</p>

<p>Starke did not dare move for a while. He was afraid his head might
fall off and whirl away like a big fish, using its ears as propellers.
"Lord," he muttered, barely turning his head.</p>

<p>The sea creature stirred. "You won. You fought Rann, and won."</p>

<p>Starke groaned. "I feel like something passed through a wild-cat's
intestines. She's gone. Rann's gone." He laughed. "That makes me sad.
Somebody cheer me up. Rann's gone." He felt of his big, flat-muscled
body. "She was bluffing. Trying to drive me batty. She knew she
couldn't really tuck me back into that carcass, but she didn't want me
to know. It was like a baby's nightmare before it's born. Or maybe you
haven't got a memory like me." He rolled over, stretching. "She won't
ever get in my head again. I've locked the gate and swallowed the key."
His eyes dilated. "What's <i>your</i> name?"</p>

<p>"Linnl," said the man with the harp. "You didn't tell Rann our
strategy?"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

<p>Linnl smiled sincerely. "I think I like you, man of Crom Dhu. I think
I like your hatred for Rann. I think I like the way you handled the
entire matter, wanted to kill Rann and save Crom Dhu, and being so
willing to die to accomplish either."</p>

<p>"That's a lot of thinking. Yeah, and what about that promise you made?"</p>

<p>"It will be kept."</p>

<p>Starke gave him a hand. "Linnl, you're okay. If I ever get back to
Earth, so help me, I'll never bait a hook again and drop it in the
sea." It was lost to Linnl. Starke forgot it, and went on, laughing.
There was an edge of hysteria to it. Relief. You got booted around
for days, people milled in and out of your mind like it was a bargain
basement counter, pawing over the treads and convolutions, yelling
and fighting; the woman you loved was starved on a ship masthead, and
as a climax a lady with green eyes tried to make you a filling for an
accident-mangled body. And now you had an ally.</p>

<p>And you couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>He laughed in little starts and stops, his eyes shut.</p>

<p>"Will you let me take care of Rann when the time comes?"</p>

<p>His fingers groped hungrily upward, closed on an imaginary figure of
her, pressed, tightened, choked.</p>

<p>Linnl said, "She's yours. I'd like the pleasure, but you have as much
if not more of a revenge to take. Come along. We start now. You've been
asleep for one entire period."</p>

<p>Starke let himself down gingerly. He didn't want to break a leg off. He
felt if someone touched him he might disintegrate.</p>

<p>He managed to let the tide handle him, do all the work. He swam
carefully after Linnl down three passageways where an occasional silver
inhabitant of the city slid by.</p>

<p>Drifting below them in a vast square hall, each gravitating but
imprisoned by leg-shackles, the warriors of Falga looked up with pale
cold eyes at Starke and Linnl. Occasional discharges of light-fish from
interstices in the walls, passed luminous, fleeting glows over the
warriors. The light-fish flirted briefly in a long shining rope that
tied knots around the dead faces and as quickly untied them. Then the
light-fish pulsed away and the red color of the sea took over.</p>

<p>Bathed in wine, thought Starke, without humor. He leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Men of Falga!"</p>

<p>Linnl plucked a series of harp-threads.</p>

<p>"Aye." A deep suggestion of sound issued from a thousand dead lips.</p>

<p>"We go to sack Rann's citadel!"</p>

<p>"Rann!" came the muffled thunder of voices.</p>

<p>At the sound of another tune, the golden hounds appeared. They touched
the chains. The men of Falga, released, danced through the red sea
substance.</p>

<p>Siphoned into a valve mouth, they were drawn out into a great volcanic
courtyard. Starke went close after. He stared down into a black ravine,
at the bottom of which was a blazing caldera.</p>

<p>This was the Source Life of the Red Sea. Here it had begun a millennium
ago. Here the savage cyclones of sparks and fire energy belched up,
shaking titanic black garden walls, causing currents and whirlpools
that threatened to suck you forward and shoot you violently up to the
surface, in cannulas of force, thrust, in capillaries of ignited mist,
in chutes of color that threatened to cremate but only exhilarated you,
gave you a seething rebirth!</p>

<p>He braced his legs and fought the suction. An unbelievable sinew of
fire sprang up from out the ravine, crackling and roaring.</p>

<p>The men of Falga did not fight the attraction.</p>

<p>They moved forward in their silence and hung over the incandescence.</p>

<p>The vitality of the Source grew upward in them. It seemed to touch
their sandaled toes first, and then by a process of shining osmosis,
climb up the limbs, into the loins, into the vitals, delineating their
strong bone structure as mercury delineates the glass thermometer with
a rise of temperature. The bones flickered like carved polished ivory
through the momentarily film-like flesh. The ribs of a thousand men
expanded like silvered spider legs, clenched, then expanded again.
Their spines straightened, their shoulders flattened back. Their eyes,
the last to take the fire, now were ignited and glowed like candles in
refurbished sepulchers. The chins snapped up, the entire outer skins of
their bodies broke into silver brilliance.</p>

<p>Swimming through the storm of energy like nightmare figments, entering
cold, they reached the far side of the ravine resembling smelted metal
from blast furnaces. When they brushed into one another, purple sparks
sizzled, jumped from head to head, from hand to hand.</p>

<p>Linnl touched Starke's arm. "You're next."</p>

<p>"No thank you."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" laughed the harp-shepherd. "You're tired. It will give you
new life. You're next."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Starke hesitated only a moment. Then he let the tide drift him rapidly
out. He was afraid. Damned afraid. A belch of fire caught him as he
arrived in the core of the ravine. He was wrapped in layers of ecstasy.
Beudag pressed against him. It was her consuming hair that netted him
and branded him. It was her warmth that crept up his body into his
chest and into his head. Somebody yelled somewhere in animal delight
and unbearable passion. Somebody danced and threw out his hands and
crushed that solar warmth deeper into his huge body. Somebody felt
all tiredness, oldness flumed away, a whole new feeling of warmth and
strength inserted.</p>

<p>That somebody was Starke.</p>

<p>Waiting on the other side of the ravine were a thousand men of Falga.
What sounded like a thousand harps began playing now, and as Starke
reached the other side, the harps began marching, and the warriors
marched with them. They were still dead, but you would never know
it. There were no minds inside those bodies. The bodies were being
activated from outside. But you would never know it.</p>

<p>They left the city behind. In embering ranks, the soldier-fighters
were led by golden hounds and distant harps to a place where a huge
intra-coastal tide swept by.</p>

<p>They got on the tide for a free ride. Linnl beside him, using his harp,
Starke felt himself sucked down through a deep where strange monsters
sprawled. They looked at Starke with hungry eyes. But the harp wall
swept them back.</p>

    <p><i>The dead warriors of Falga moved silently to battle.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>Starke glanced about at the men. They don't know what they're doing, he
thought. Going home to kill their parents and their children, to set
the flame to Falga, and they don't know it. Their alive-but-dead faces
tilted up, always upward, as though visions of Rann's citadel were
there.</p>

<p>Rann. Starke let the wrath simmer in him. He let it cool. Then it was
cold. Rann hadn't bothered him now for hours. Was there a chance she'd
read his thought in the midst of that fighting nightmare? Did she know
this plan for Falga? Was that an explanation for her silence now?</p>

<p>He sent his mind ahead, subtly. <i>Rann. Rann.</i> The only answer was the
move of silver bodies through the fiery deeps.</p>

<p>Just before dawn they broke the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Falga drowsed in the red-smeared fog silence. Its slave streets were
empty and dew-covered. High up, the first light was bathing Rann's
gardens and setting her citadel aglow.</p>

<p>Linnl lay in the shallows beside Starke. They both were smiling
half-cruel smiles. They had waited long for this.</p>

<p>Linnl nodded. "This is the day of the carnival. Fruit, wine and love
will be offered the returned soldiers of Rann. In the streets there'll
be dancing."</p>

<p>Far over to the right lay a rise of mountain. At its blunt peak&mdash;Starke
stared at it intently&mdash;rested a body of a little, scrawny Earthman,
with flame-birds clustered on it. He'd climb that mountain later. When
it was over and there was time.</p>

<p>"What are you searching for?" asked Linnl.</p>

<p>Starke's voice was distant. "Someone I used to know."</p>

<p>Filing out on the stone quays, their rustling sandals eroded by time,
the men stood clean and bright. Starke paced, a caged animal, at their
center, so his dark body would pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>They were seen.</p>

<p>The cliff guard looked down over the dirty slave dwellings, from their
arrow galleries, and set up a cry. Hands waved, pointed frosty white
in the dawn. More guards loped down the ramps and galleries, meeting,
joining others and coming on.</p>

<p>Linnl, in the sea by the quay, suggested a theme on the harp. The other
harps took it up. The shuddering music lifted from the water and with
a gentle firmness, set the dead feet marching down the quays, upward
through the narrow, stifling alleys of the slaves, to meet the guard.</p>

<p>Slave people peered out at them tiredly from their choked quarters. The
passing of warriors was old to them, of no significance.</p>

<p>These warriors carried no weapons. Starke didn't like that part of it.
A length of chain even, he wanted. But this emptiness of the hands.
His teeth ached from too long a time of clenching his jaws tight. The
muscles of his arms were feverish and nervous.</p>

<p>At the edge of the slave community, at the cliff base, the guard
confronted them. Running down off the galleries, swords naked, they ran
to intercept what they took to be an enemy.</p>

<p>The guards stopped in blank confusion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little laugh escaped Starke's lips. It was a dream. With fog over,
under and in between its parts. It wasn't real to the guard, who
couldn't believe it. It wasn't real to these dead men either, who were
walking around. He felt alone. He was the only live one. He didn't like
walking with dead men.</p>

<p>The captain of the guard came down warily, his green eyes suspicious.
The suspicion faded. His face fell apart. He had lain on his fur pelts
for months thinking of his son who had died to defend Falga.</p>

<p>Now his son stood before him. Alive.</p>

<p>The captain forgot he was captain. He forgot everything. His sandals
scraped over stones. You could hear the air go out of his lungs and
come back in in a numbed prayer.</p>

<p>"My son! In Rann's name. They said you were slain by Faolan's men one
hundred darknesses ago. My son!"</p>

<p>A harp tinkled somewhere.</p>

<p>The son stepped forward, smiling.</p>

<p>They embraced. The son said nothing. He couldn't speak.</p>

<p>This was the signal for the others. The whole guard, shocked and
surprised, put away their swords and sought out old friends, brothers,
fathers, uncles, sons!</p>

<p>They moved up the galleries, the guard and the returned warriors,
Starke in their midst. Threading up the cliff, through passage after
passage, all talking at once. Or so it seemed. The guards did the
talking. None of the dead warriors replied. They only <i>seemed</i> to.
Starke heard the music strong and clear everywhere.</p>

<p>They reached the green gardens atop the cliff. By this time the entire
city was awake. Women came running, bare-breasted and sobbing, and
throwing themselves forward into the ranks of their lovers. Flowers
showered over them.</p>

<p>"So this is war," muttered Starke, uneasily.</p>

<p>They stopped in the center of the great gardens. The crowd milled
happily, not yet aware of the strange silence from their men. They were
too happy to notice.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Starke to himself. "Now's the time. Now!"</p>

<p>As if in answer, a wild skirling of harps out of the sky.</p>

<p>The crowd stopped laughing only when the returned warriors of Falga
swept forward, their hands lifted and groping before them....</p>

<p>The crying in the streets was like a far siren wailing. Metal made a
harsh clangor that was sheathed in silence at the same moment metal
found flesh to lie in. A vicious pantomime was concluded in the green
moist gardens.</p>

<p>Starke watched from Rann's empty citadel. Fog plumes strolled by the
archways and a thick rain fell. It came like a blood squall and washed
the garden below until you could not tell rain from blood.</p>

<p>The returned warriors had gotten their swords by now. First they killed
those nearest them in the celebration. Then they took the weapons from
the victims. It was very simple and very unpleasant.</p>

<p>The slaves had joined battle now. Swarming up from the slave town,
plucking up fallen daggers and short swords, they circled the gardens,
happening upon the arrogant shining warriors of Rann who had so far
escaped the quiet, deadly killing of the alive-but-dead men.</p>

<p>Dead father killed startled, alive son. Dead brother garroted
unbelieving brother. Carnival indeed in Falga.</p>

<p>An old man waited alone. Starke saw him. The old man had a weapon, but
refused to use it. A young warrior of Falga, harped on by Linnl's harp,
walked quietly up to the old man. The old man cried out. His mouth
formed words. "Son! What <i>is</i> this?" He flung down his blade and made
to plead with his boy.</p>

<p>The son stabbed him with silent efficiency, and without a glance at the
body, walked onward to find another.</p>

<p>Starke turned away, sick and cold.</p>

<p>A thousand such scenes were being finished.</p>

<p>He set fire to the black spider-silk tapestries. They whispered and
talked with flame. The stone echoed his feet as he searched room after
room. Rann had gone, probably last night. That meant that Crom Dhu
was on the verge of falling. Was Faolan dead? Had the people of Crom
Dhu, seeing Beudag's suffering, given in? Falga's harbor was completely
devoid of ships, except for small fishing skiffs.</p>

<p>The fog waited him when he returned to the garden. Rain found his face.</p>

<p>The citadel of Rann was fire-encrusted and smoke shrouded as he looked
up at it.</p>

<p>A silence lay in the garden. The fight was over.</p>

<p>The men of Falga, still shining with Source-Life, hung their blades
from uncomprehending fingers, the light beginning to leave their green
eyes. Their skin looked dirty and dull.</p>

<p>Starke wasted no time getting down the galleries, through the slave
quarter, and to the quays again.</p>

<p>Linnl awaited him, gently petting the obedient harp.</p>

<p>"It's over. The slaves will own what's left. They'll be our allies,
since we've freed them."</p>

<p>Starke didn't hear. He was squinting off over the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Linnl understood. He plucked two tones from the harp, which pronounced
the two words uppermost in Starke's thought.</p>

<p>"Crom Dhu."</p>

<p>"If we're not too late." Starke leaned forward. "If Faolan lives. If
Beudag still stands at the masthead."</p>

<p>Like a blind man he walked straight ahead, until he fell into the sea.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not quite a million miles to Crom Dhu. It only seemed that far.</p>

<p>A sweep of tide picked them up just off shore from Falga and siphoned
them rapidly, through deeps along coastal latitudes, through crystal
forests. He cursed every mile of the way.</p>

<p>He cursed the time it took to pause at the Titan's city to gather fresh
men. To gather Clev and Mannt and Aesur and Bruce. Impatiently, Starke
watched the whole drama of the Source-Fire and the bodies again. This
time it was the bodies of Crom Dhu men, hung like beasts on slow-turned
spits, their limbs and vitals soaking through and through, their
skins taking bronze color, their eyes holding flint-sparks. And then
the harps wove a garment around each, and the garment moved the men
instead of the men the garment.</p>

<p>In the tidal basilic now, Starke twisted. Coursing behind him were the
new bodies of Clev and Aesur! The current elevated them, poked them
through obsidian needle-eyes like spider-silk threads.</p>

<p>There was good irony in this. Crom Dhu's men, fallen at Falga under
Conan's treachery, returned now under Conan, to exonerate that
treachery.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were in Crom Dhu's outer basin. Shadows swept over them.
The long dark falling shadows of Falga's longboats lying in that
harbor. Shadows like black culling-nets let down. The school of men
cleaved the shadow nets. The tide ceased here, eddied and distilled
them.</p>

<p>Starke glared up at the immense silver bottom of a Falgian ship. He
felt his face stiffen and his throat tighten. Then, flexing knees, he
rammed upward, night air broke dark red around his head.</p>

<p>The harbor held flare torches on the rims of long ships. On the neck
of land that led from Crom Dhu to the mainland the continuing battle
sounded. Faint cries and clashing made their way through the fog veils.
They sounded like echoes of past dreams.</p>

<p>Linnl let Starke have the leash. Starke felt something pressed into his
fist. A coil of slender green woven reeds, a rope with hooked weights
on the end of it. He knew how to use it without asking. But he wished
for a knife, now, even though he realized carrying a knife in the sea
was all but impossible if you wanted to move fast.</p>

<p>He saw the sleek naked figurehead of Rann's best ship a hundred yards
away, a floating silhouette, its torches hanging fire like Beudag's
hair.</p>

<p>He swam toward it, breathing quietly. When at last the silvered
figurehead with the mocking green eyes and the flag of shoal-shallow
hair hung over him, he felt the cool white ship metal kiss his fingers.</p>

<p>The smell of torch-smoke lingered. A rise of faint shouts from the
land told of another rush upon the Gate. Behind him&mdash;a ripple. Then&mdash;a
thousand ripples.</p>

<p>The resurrected men of Crom Dhu rose in dents and stirrings of
sparkling wine. They stared at Crom Dhu and maybe they knew what it
was and maybe they didn't. For one moment, Starke felt apprehension.
Suppose Linnl was playing a game. Suppose, once these men had won the
battle, they went on into Crom Dhu, to rupture Romna's harp and make
Faolan the blinder? He shook the thought away. That would have to be
handled in time. On either side of him Clev and Mannt appeared. They
looked at Crom Dhu, their lips shut. Maybe they saw Faolan's eyrie and
heard a harp that was more than these harps that sang them to blade and
plunder&mdash;Romna's instrument telling bard-tales of the rovers and the
coastal wars and the old, living days. Their eyes looked and looked at
Crom Dhu, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>The sea shepherds appeared now; the followers of Linnl, each with his
harp and the harp music began, high. So high you couldn't hear it. It
wove a tension on the air.</p>

<p>Silently, with a grim certainty, the dead-but-not-dead gathered in a
bronze circle about Rann's ship. The very silence of their encirclement
made your skin crawl and sweat break cold on your cheeks.</p>

<p>A dozen ropes went raveling, looping over the ship side. They caught,
held, grapnelled, hooked.</p>

<p>Starke had thrown his, felt it bite and hold. Now he scrambled swiftly,
cursing, up its length, kicking and slipping at the silver hull.</p>

<p>He reached the top.</p>

<p>Beudag was there.</p>

<p>Half over the low rail he hesitated, just looking at her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Torchlight limned her, shadowed her. She was still erect; her head was
tired and her eyes were closed, her face thinned and less brown, but
she was still alive. She was coming out of a deep stupor now, at the
whistle of ropes and the grate of metal hooks on the deck.</p>

<p>She saw Starke and her lips parted. She did not look away from him. His
breath came out of him, choking.</p>

<p>It almost cost him his life, his standing there, looking at her.</p>

<p>A guard, with flesh like new snow, shafted his bow from the turret and
let it loose. A chain lay on deck. Thankfully, Starke took it.</p>

<p>Clev came over the rail beside Starke. His chest took the arrow. The
shaft burst half through and stopped, held. Clev kept going after the
man who had shot it. He caught up with him.</p>

<p>Beudag cried out. "Behind you, Conan!"</p>

<p>Conan! In her excitement, she gave the old name.</p>

<p>Conan he <i>was</i>. Whirling, he confronted a wiry little fellow, chained
him brutally across the face, seized the man's falling sword, used it
on him. Then he walked in, got the man's jaw, unbalanced him over into
the sea.</p>

<p>The ship was awake now. Most of the men had been down below, resting
from the battles. Now they came pouring up, in a silver spate. Their
yelling was in strange contrast to the calm silence of Crom Dhu's men.
Starke found himself busy.</p>

<p>Conan had been a healthy animal, with great recuperative powers. Now
his muscles responded to every trick asked of them. Starke leaped
cleanly across the deck, watching for Rann, but she was no where to be
seen. He engaged two blades, dispatched one of them. More ropes raveled
high and snaked him. Every ship in the harbor was exploding with
violence. More men swarmed over the rail behind Starke, silently.</p>

<p>Above the shouting, Beudag's voice came, at sight of the fighting men.
"Clev! Mannt! Aesur!"</p>

<p>Starke was a god, anything he wanted he could have. A man's head? He
could have it. It meant acting the guillotine with knife and wrist
and lunged body. Like&mdash;<i>this</i>! His eyes were smoking amber and there
were deep lines of grim pleasure tugging at his lips. An enemy cannot
fight without hands. One man, facing Starke, suddenly displayed violent
stumps before his face, not believing them.</p>

<p>Are you watching, Faolan, cried Starke inside himself, delivering
blows. Look here, Faolan! God, no, you're blind. <i>Listen</i> then! Hear
the ring of steel on steel. Does the smell of hot blood and hot bodies
reach you? Oh, if you could see this tonight, Faolan. Falga would
be forgotten. This is Conan, out of idiocy, with a guy named Starke
wearing him and telling him where to go!</p>

<p>It was not safe on deck. Starke hadn't particularly noticed before, but
the warriors of Crom Dhu didn't care whom they attacked now. They were
beginning to do surgery to one another. They excised one another's
shoulders, severed limbs in blind instantaneous obedience. This was no
place for Beudag and himself.</p>

<p>He cut her free of the masthead, drew her quickly to the rail.</p>

<p>Beudag was laughing. She could do nothing but laugh. Her eyes were
shocked. She saw dead men alive again, lashing out with weapons; she
had been starved and made to stand night and day, and now she could
only laugh.</p>

<p>Starke shook her.</p>

<p>She did not stop laughing.</p>

<p>"Beudag! You're all right. You're free."</p>

<p>She stared at nothing. "I'll&mdash;I'll be all right in a minute."</p>

<p>He had to ward off a blow from one of his own men. He parried the
thrust, then got in and pushed the man off the deck, over into the sea.
That was the only thing to do. You couldn't kill them.</p>

<p>Beudag stared down at the tumbling body.</p>

<p>"Where's Rann?" Starke's yellow eyes narrowed, searching.</p>

<p>"She <i>was</i> here." Beudag trembled.</p>

<p>Rann looked out of her eyes. Out of the tired numbness of Beudag, an
echo of Rann. Rann was nearby, and this was her doing.</p>

<p>Instinctively, Starke raised his eyes.</p>

<p>Rann appeared at the masthead, like a flurry of snow. Her green-tipped
breasts were rising and falling with emotion. Pure hatred lay in her
eyes. Starke licked his lips and readied his sword.</p>

<p>Rann snapped a glance at Beudag. Stooping, as in a dream, Beudag picked
up a dagger and held it to her own breast.</p>

<p>Starke froze.</p>

<p>Rann nodded, with satisfaction. "Well, Starke? How will it be? Will you
come at me and have Beudag die? Or will you let me go free?"</p>

<p>Starke's palms felt sweaty and greasy. "There's no place for you to go.
Falga's taken. I can't guarantee your freedom. If you want to go over
the side, into the sea, that's your chance. You might make shore and
your own men."</p>

<p>"Swimming? With the sea-<i>beasts</i> waiting?" She accented the <i>beasts</i>
heavily. She was one of the sea-<i>people</i>. They, Linnl and his men, were
sea-<i>beasts</i>. "No, Hugh Starke. I'll take a skiff. Put Beudag at the
rail where I can watch her all the way. Guarantee my passage to shore
and my own men there, and Beudag lives."</p>

<p>Starke waved his sword. "Get going."</p>

<p>He didn't want to let her go. He had other plans, good plans for
her. He shouted the deal down at Linnl. Linnl nodded back, with much
reluctance.</p>

<p>Rann, in a small silver skiff, headed toward land. She handled the
boat and looked back at Beudag all the while. She passed through the
sea-beasts and touched the shore. She lifted her hand and brought it
smashing down.</p>

<p>Whirling, Starke swung his fist against Beudag's jaw. Her hand was
already striking the blade into her breast. Her head flopped back.
His fist carried through. She fell. The blade clattered. He kicked it
overboard. Then he lifted Beudag. She was warm and good to hold. The
blade had only pricked her breast. A small rivulet of blood ran.</p>

<p>On the shore, Rann vanished upward on the rocks, hurrying to find her
men.</p>

<p>In the harbor the harp music paused. The ships were taken. Their crews
lay filling the decks. Crom Dhu's men stopped fighting as quickly as
they'd started. Some of the bright shining had dulled from the bronze
of their arms and bare torsos. The ships began to sink.</p>

<p>Linnl swam below, looking up at Starke. Starke looked back at him and
nodded at the beach. "Swell. Now, let's go get that she-devil," he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Faolan waited on his great stone balcony, overlooking Crom Dhu. Behind
him the fires blazed high and their eating sound of flame on wood
filled the pillared gloom with sound and furious light.</p>

<p>Faolan leaned against the rim, his chest swathed in bandage and healing
ointment, his blind eyes flickering, looking down again and again with
a fixed intensity, his head tilted to listen.</p>

<p>Romna stood beside him, filled and refilled the cup that Faolan
emptied into his thirsty mouth, and told him what happened. Told of
the men pouring out of the sea, and Rann appearing on the rocky shore.
Sometimes Faolan leaned to one side, weakly, toward Romna's words.
Sometimes he twisted to hear the thing itself, the thing that happened
down beyond the Gate of besieged Falga.</p>

<p>Romna's harp lay untouched. He didn't play it. He didn't need to. From
below, a great echoing of harps, more liquid than his, like a waterfall
drenched the city, making the fog sob down red tears.</p>

<p>"Are those harps?" cried Faolan.</p>

<p>"Yes, harps!"</p>

<p>"What was that?" Faolan listened, breathing harshly, clutching for
support.</p>

<p>"A skirmish," said Romna.</p>

<p>"Who won?"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> won."</p>

<p>"And <i>that</i>?" Faolan's blind eyes tried to see until they watered.</p>

<p>"The enemy falling back from the Gate!"</p>

<p>"And that sound, and that sound!" Faolan went on and on, feverishly,
turning this way and that, the lines of his face agonized and attentive
to each eddy and current and change of tide. The rhythm of swords
through fog and body was a complicated music whose themes he must
recognize. "Another fell! I heard him cry. And another of Rann's men!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Romna.</p>

<p>"But why do our warriors fight so quietly? I've heard nothing from
their lips. So quiet."</p>

<p>Romna scowled. "Quiet. Yes&mdash;quiet."</p>

<p>"And where did they come from? All our men are in the city?"</p>

<p>"Aye." Romna shifted. He hesitated, squinting. He rubbed his bulldog
jaw. "Except those that died at&mdash;Falga."</p>

<p>Faolan stood there a moment. Then he rapped his empty cup.</p>

<p>"More wine, bard. More wine."</p>

<p>He turned to the battle again.</p>

<p>"Oh, gods, if I could see it, if I could only see it!"</p>

<p>Below, a ringing crash. A silence. A shouting, a pouring of noise.</p>

<p>"The Gate!" Faolan was stricken with fear. "We've lost! My sword!"</p>

<p>"Stay, Faolan!" Romna laughed. Then he sighed. It was a sigh that did
not believe. "In the name of ten thousand mighty gods. Would that I
were blind now, or could see better."</p>

<p>Faolan's hand caught, held him. "What <i>is</i> it? Tell!"</p>

<p>"Clev! And Tlan! And Conan! And Blucc! And Mannt! Standing in the gate,
like wine visions! Swords in their hands!"</p>

<p>Faolan's hand relaxed, then tightened. "Speak their names again, and
speak them slowly. And tell the truth." His skin shivered like that of
a nervous animal. "You said&mdash;Clev? Mannt? Blucc?"</p>

<p>"And Tlan! And Conan! Back from Falga. They've opened the Gate and the
battle's won. It's over, Faolan. Crom Dhu will sleep tonight."</p>

<p>Faolan let him go. A sob broke from his lips. "I will get drunk.
Drunker than ever in my life. Gloriously drunk. Gods, but if I could
have seen it. Been in it. Tell me again of it, Romna...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Faolan sat in the great hall, on his carved high-seat, waiting.</p>

<p>The pad of sandals on stone, outside, the jangle of chains.</p>

<p>A door flung wide, red fog sluiced in, and in the sluice, people
walking. Faolan started up. "Clev? Mannt? Aesur!"</p>

<p>Starke came forward into the firelight. He pressed his right hand to
the open mouth of the wound on his thigh. "No, Faolan. Myself and two
others."</p>

<p>"Beudag?"</p>

<p>"Yes." And Beudag came wearily to him.</p>

<p>Faolan stared. "Who's the other? It walks light. It's a woman."</p>

<p>Starke nodded. "Rann."</p>

<p>Faolan rose carefully from his seat. He thought the name over. He took
a short sword from a place beside the high seat. He stepped down. He
walked toward Starke. "You brought Rann alive to me?"</p>

<p>Starke pulled the chain that bound Rann. She ran forward in little
steps, her white face down, her eyes slitted with animal fury.</p>

<p>"Faolan's blind," said Starke. "I let you live for one damned good
reason, Rann. Okay, go ahead."</p>

<p>Faolan stopped walking, curious. He waited.</p>

<p>Rann did nothing.</p>

<p>Starke took her hand and wrenched it behind her back. "I said 'go
ahead.' Maybe you didn't hear me."</p>

<p>"I will," she gasped, in pain.</p>

<p>Starke released her. "Tell me what happens, Faolan."</p>

<p>Rann gazed steadily at Faolan's tall figure there in the light.</p>

<p>Faolan suddenly threw his hands to his eyes and choked.</p>

<p>Beudag cried out, seized his arm.</p>

<p>"I can see!" Faolan staggered, as if jolted. "I can see!" First he
shouted it, then he whispered it. "<i>I can see.</i>"</p>

<p>Starke's eyes blurred. He whispered to Rann, tightly. "Make him see it,
Rann or you die now. Make him see it!" to Faolan. "What do you see?"</p>

<p>Faolan was bewildered, he swayed. He put out his hands to shape the
vision. "I&mdash;I see Crom Dhu. It's a good sight. I see the ships of Rann.
Sinking!" He laughed a broken laugh. "I&mdash;see the fight beyond the gate!"</p>

<p>Silence swam in the room, over their heads.</p>

<p>Faolan's voice went alone, and hypnotized, into that silence.</p>

<p>He put out his big fists, shook them, opened them. "I see Mannt, and
Aesur and Clev! Fighting as they always fought. I see Conan as he
was. I see Beudag wielding steel again, on the shore! I see the enemy
killed! I see men pouring out of the sea with brown skins and dark
hair. Men I knew a long darkness ago. Men that roved the sea with me.
<i>I see Rann captured!</i>" He began to sob with it, his lungs filling and
releasing it, sucking in on it, blowing it out. Tears ran down from his
vacant, blazing eyes. "I see Crom Dhu as it was and is and shall be! <i>I
see, I see, I see!</i>"</p>

<p>Starke felt the chill on the back of his neck.</p>

<p>"I see Rann captured and held, and her men dead around her on the land
before the Gate. I see the Gate thrown open&mdash;" Faolan halted. He looked
at Starke. "Where are Clev and Mannt? Where is Blucc and Aesur?"</p>

<p>Starke let the fires burn on the hearths a long moment. Then he replied.</p>

<p>"They went back into the sea, Faolan."</p>

<p>Faolan's fingers fell emptily. "Yes," he said, heavily. "They had to
go back, didn't they? They couldn't stay, could they? Not even for one
night of food on the table, and wine in the mouth, and women in the
deep warm furs before the hearth. Not even for one toast." He turned.
"A drink, Romna. A drink for everyone."</p>

<p>Romna gave him a full cup. He dropped it, fell down to his knees,
clawed at his breasts. "My heart!"</p>

<p>"Rann, you sea-devil!"</p>

<p>Starke held her instantly by the throat. He put pressure on the small
raging pulses on either side of her snow-white neck. "Let him go,
Rann!" More pressure. "<i>Let him go!</i>" Faolan grunted. Starke held her
until her white face was dirty and strange with death.</p>

<p>It seemed like an hour later when he released her. She fell softly and
did not move. She wouldn't move again.</p>

<p>Starke turned slowly to look at Faolan.</p>

<p>"You saw, didn't you, Faolan?" he said.</p>

<p>Faolan nodded blindly, weakly. He roused himself from the floor,
groping. "I saw. For a moment, I saw everything. And Gods! but it made
good seeing! Here, Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan, give this other side of me
something to lean on."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beudag and Starke climbed the mountain above Falga the next day. Starke
went ahead a little way, and with his coming the flame birds scattered,
glittering away.</p>

<p>He dug the shallow grave and did what had to be done with the body he
found there, and then when the grave was covered with thick grey stones
he went back for Beudag. They stood together over it. He had never
expected to stand over a part of himself, but here he was, and Beudag's
hand gripped his.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/illus3.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>He looked suddenly a million years old standing there. He thought of
Earth and the Belt and Jupiter, of the joy streets in the Jekkara Low
Canals of Mars. He thought of space and the ships going through it, and
himself inside them. He thought of the million credits he had taken in
that last job. He laughed ironically.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, I'll have the sea creatures hunt for a little metal box full
of credits." He nodded solemnly at the grave. "He wanted that. Or at
least he thought. He killed himself getting it. So if the sea people
find it, I'll send it up here to the mountain and bury it down under
the rocks in his fingers. I guess that's the best place."</p>

<p>Beudag drew him away. They walked down the mountain toward Falga's
harbor where a ship waited them. Walking, Starke lifted his face.
Beudag was with him, and the sails of the ship were rising to take the
wind, and the Red Sea waited for them to travel it. What lay on its far
side was something for Beudag and Faolan-of-the-Ships and Romna and
Hugh-Starke-Called-Conan to discover. He felt damned good about it. He
walked on steadily, holding Beudag near.</p>

<p>And on the mountain, as the ship sailed, the flame birds soared down
fitfully and frustratedly to beat at the stone mound; ceased, and
mourning shrilly, flew away.</p>

<h1>ROCKET SUMMER</h1>
<p>The crowd gathered to make a curious noise this cold grey morning
before the scheduled Birth. They arrived in gleaming scarlet
tumble-bugs and yellow plastic beetles, yawning and singing and ready.
The Birth was a big thing for them.</p>

<p>He stood alone up in his high office tower window, watching them with
a sad impatience in his grey eyes. His name was William Stanley,
president of the company that owned this building and all those other
work-hangars down on the tarmac, and all that landing field stretching
two miles off into the Jersey mists. William Stanley was thinking about
the Birth.</p>

<p>The Birth of <i>what</i>? Stanley's large, finely sculptured head felt
heavier, older. Science, with a scalpel of intense flame would slash
wide the skulls of engineers, chemists, mechanics in a titanic
Caesarian, and out would come the Rocket!</p>

<p>"Yezzir! Yezzir!" he heard the far-off, faint and raucous declarations
of the vendors and hawkers. "Buy ya Rocket Toys! Buy ya Rocket Games!
Rocket Pictures! Rocket soap! Rocket teethers for the tiny-tot! Rocket,
Rocket, Rocket! <i>Hey!</i>"</p>

<p>Shutting the open glassite frame before him, his thin lips drew tight.
Morning after morning America sent her pilgrims to this shrine. They
peered in over the translucent restraint barrier as if the Rocket were
a caged beast.</p>

<p>He saw one small girl drop her Rocket toy. It shattered, and was folded
under by the moving crowd's feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley?"</p>

<p>"Uh? Oh, Captain Greenwald. Sorry. Forgot you were here." Stanley
measured his slow, thoughtful steps to his clean-topped desk.
"Captain," he sighed wearily, "you're looking at the unhappiest man
alive." He looked at Greenwald across the desk. "That Rocket is the
gift of a too-generous science to a civilization of adult-children
who've fiddled with dynamite ever since Nobel invented it. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got no further. The office door burst inward. A tall, work-grimed
man strode swiftly in&mdash;all oil, all heat, all sunburnt, wrinkled
leather skin. Rocket flame burnt in his dark, glaring eyes. He stopped
short at Stanley's desk, breathing heavily, leaning against it.</p>

<p>Stanley noticed the wrench in the man's fist. "Hello, Simpson."</p>

<p>Simpson swore bitterly. "What's all this guff about you stopping the
Rocket tomorrow?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Stanley nodded. "This isn't a good time for it to go up."</p>

<p>Simpson snorted. "This isn't a good time," he mimicked. Then he
swore again. "By George, it's like telling a woman her baby's been
still-born!"</p>

<p>"I know it's hard to understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hard, <i>hell</i>!" shouted the man. "I'm Head Mechanic! I've worked two
years! The others have worked, too! And the Rocket'll travel tomorrow
or we'll know why!"</p>

<p>Stanley crushed out his cigar, inside his fist. The room swayed
imperceptibly in his vision. Sometimes, one wanted to use a gun&mdash;he
shook away the thought. He kept his tongue.</p>

<p>Simpson raged on. "Mr. Stanley, you have until three this afternoon to
change your mind. We'll pull strings and you'll be out of your job by
the week-end! If not&mdash;" and he said the next words very slowly, "how
would your wife look with her head bashed in, <i>Mister</i> Stanley?"</p>

<p>"You can't threaten me!"</p>

<p>The door slammed in Stanley's face. Simpson was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Captain Greenwald put out a manicured hand. On one slender finger shone
a diamond ring. His wrist was circled by an expensive watch. His shiny
brown eyes were invisibly cupped by contact lenses. Greenwald was past
fifty inside; outside he seemed barely thirty. "I advise you to forget
it, Stanley. Man's waited a million years for tomorrow."</p>

<p>Stanley's hand shook, lighting a cigarette. "Look here, Captain, where
<i>are</i> you going?"</p>

<p>"To the stars, of course."</p>

<p>Stanley snapped out the alcohol match. "In the name of heaven, stop the
melodrama and inferior semantics. What kind of thing is this you're
handing the people? What'll it do to races, morals, men and women?"</p>

<p>Greenwald laughed. "I'm only interested in reaching the Moon. Then I'll
come back to earth, and retire, happily, and die."</p>

<p>Stanley stood there, tall and very grey. "Does the effect of the
introduction of the crossbow to English and French history interest
you?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I know much about it."</p>

<p>"Do you recall what gunpowder's invention did to civilization?"</p>

<p>"That's irrelevant!"</p>

<p>"You must admit if there'd been some subjective planning with the
auto and airplane, millions of lives would've been saved, and many
wars prevented. An ethical code should've been written for all such
inventions and strictly observed, or else the invention forfeited."</p>

<p>Greenwald shook his head, grinning. "I'll let you handle that half of
it. I'll do the traveling. I'm willing to abide by any such rules, if
you'll draw them up and enforce them. All I want is to reach the Moon
first. I've got to get downstairs now. We're still loading the ship,
you know, in spite of your decree. We expect to get around you somehow.
I'm sympathetic, of course, to your beliefs. I'll do anything you say
except ground the Rocket. I won't get violent, but I can't vouch for
Simpson. He's a tough man, with strong notions."</p>

<p>They walked from the office to the dropper. Compression slid them down
to ground level, where they stepped out, Stanley still re-emphasizing
his beliefs. "&mdash;for centuries science has given humanity play-toys,
ships, machines, guns, cars, and now a Rocket, all with supreme
disregard for man's needs."</p>

<p>"Science," announced Greenwald as they emerged onto the tarmac, "has
produced, via private enterprise, greater amounts of goods than ever in
history! Why, consider the medical developments!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stanley doggedly, "we cure man's cancer and preserve his
greed in a special serum. They used to say 'Starve a cold, stuff a
fever.' Today's fever is materialism. All the things science has
produced only touch the <i>Body</i>. When Science invents something to touch
the Mind, I'll give it its due. No.</p>

<p>"You cloak your voyage with romantic terminology. Outward to the stars!
you cry! Words! What's the <i>fact</i>? Why, <i>why</i> this rocket? Greater
production? We have <i>that</i>! Adventure? Poor excuse to uproot Earth.
Exploration? It <i>could</i> wait a few years. Lebensraum? Hardly. <i>Why</i>,
then, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" murmured Greenwald distractedly. "Ah. Here's the Rocket, now."</p>

<p>They walked in the incredible Rocket shadow. Stanley looked at the
crowd beyond the barrier. "<i>Look</i> at them. Their sex still a mixture
of Victorian voodoo and clabbered Freud. With education needing
reorientation, with wars threatening, with religion and philosophy
confused, you want to jump off into space!"</p>

<p>Stanley shook his head. "Oh, I don't doubt your sincerity, Captain. I
just say your timing's poor. If we give them a Rocket toy to play with,
do you honestly think they'll solve war, education, unity, thought?
Why, they'd propel themselves away from it so quickly your head'd swim!
Wars would be fought between worlds. But if we want more wars, let's
have them <i>here</i>, where we can get at their sources, before we leap to
the asteroids seeking our lost pride of race.</p>

<p>"What little unity we <i>do</i> have would be broken by countries and
individuals clamoring and cut-throating for planets and satellites!"</p>

<p>Pausing, Stanley saw the mechanics standing in the Rocket shadow,
hating him. Outside the barrier, the crowd recognized him; their murmur
grew to a roar of disapproval.</p>

<p>Greenwald indicated them. "They're wondering why you waited so long
before deciding to stop the Rocket."</p>

<p>"Tell them I thought there'd be laws controlling it. Tell them the
corporations played along, smiling and bobbing to me, until the Rocket
was completed. Then they threw off their false faces and withdrew the
legislation only this morning. Tell them that, Captain. And tell them
the legislation I planned would've meant a slow, intelligent Rocket
expansion over an era of three centuries. Then ask them if they think
any business man could wait even five <i>minutes</i>."</p>

<p>Captain Greenwald scowled. "All I want to do is prove it can be done.
After I come back down, if I can help in any way to control the Rocket,
I'm your man, Stanley. After I <i>prove</i> it's possible, I don't care what
in hell happens...."</p>

<p>Stanley slid into his 'copter, waved morosely at the captain. The crowd
shouted, waved its fists at him over the barrier. He sat watching their
distorted, sullen faces. They detested him. The Rocket balloon man, the
Rocket soap man, the tourists detested him.</p>

<p>What was more, when his son Tommy found out, Tommy would hate him, too.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He took his time, heading home. He let the green hills slide under.
He set the automatic pilot and sank back into the sponge-softness,
suspended in a humming, blissful dream. Music played. Cigarettes and
whiskey were in reach if he desired them. Soft music. He could lapse
back into the dreaming tide, dissolve worry, smoke, drink, chortle
luxuriously, sleep, forget, pull a shell of synthetic, hypnotizing
objects in about himself.</p>

<p>And wake ten years from today with his wife disintegrating swiftly in
his arms. And one day see his son's skull shattered against a plastic
wall.</p>

<p>And his own heart whirled and burst by some vast atom power of a
starship passing Earth far out in space!</p>

<p>He dumped the whiskey over the side, followed it with the cigarettes.
Finally, he clicked off the soft music.</p>

<p>There was his home. His eyes kindled. It lay out upon a green meadow,
far from the villages and towns, salt-white and surrounded by tapered
sycamores. As he watched, lowering his 'copter, he saw the blonde
streak across the lawn; that was his daughter, Alyce. Somewhere else on
the premises his son gamboled. Neither of them feared the dark.</p>

<p>Angrily, Stanley poured on full speed. The landscape jerked and
vanished behind him. He wanted to be alone. He couldn't face them, yet.
Speed was the answer. Wind whistled, roared, rushed by the hurtling
'copter. He rammed it on. Color rose in his cheeks.</p>

<p>There was music in the garden as he parked his 'copter in the fine blue
plastic garage. Oh, beautiful garage, he thought, you contribute to my
peacefulness. Oh, wonderful garage, in moments of torment, I think of
you, and I am glad I own you.</p>

<p>Like hell.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Althea was whipping food with mechanisms. Her mother
sat with one withered ear to the latest audio drama. They glanced up,
pleased.</p>

<p>"Darling, so early!" she cried, kissing him. "How's the Rocket?" piped
mother-in-law. "My, I bet you're proud!"</p>

<p>Stanley said nothing.</p>

<p>"Just imagine." The old woman's eyes glowed like little bulbs. "Soon
we'll breakfast in New York and supper on Mars!"</p>

<p>Stanley watched her for a long moment, then turned hopefully to Althea.
"What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

<p>She sensed a trap. "Well, it would be different, wouldn't it,
vacationing our summers on Venus, winters on Mars&mdash;wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, good Lord," he groaned. He shut his eyes and pounded the table,
softly. "Good Lord."</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, what's wrong. What did <i>I</i> say?" demanded Althea, bewildered.</p>

<p>He told them about his order preventing the flight.</p>

<p>Althea stared at him. Mother reached and snapped off the audio. "<i>What</i>
did you say, young man?"</p>

<p>He repeated it.</p>

<p>Into the waiting silence came a distant "psssheeew!" rushing in from
the dining room, flinging the kitchen door wide, his son ran in, waving
a bright red Rocket in one grimy fist. "Psssheeew! I'm a Rocket!
Gangway! Hi, Dad!" He swung the ship in a quick arc. "Gonna be a pilot
when I'm sixteen! Hey." He stopped. "What's everybody standing around
for?" He looked at Grandma. "Grammy?" He looked at his mother. "Mom?"
And finally at his father. "Dad...?" His hands sank slowly. He read the
look in his father's eyes. "Oh, gosh."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By three o'clock that afternoon, he had showered and dressed in clean
clothes. The house was very silent. Althea came and sat down in the
living room and looked at him with hurt, stricken eyes.</p>

<p>He thought of quoting a few figures at her. Five million people killed
in auto accidents since the year 1920. Fifty thousand people killed
every year, <i>now</i>, in 'copters and jet-planes. But it wasn't in the
figures, it was in a feeling he had to make her <i>feel</i>. Maybe he could
illustrate it to her. He picked up the hand-audio, dialed a number.
"Hello, Smitty?"</p>

<p>The voice on the other end said, clearly, "Oh, Mr. Stanley?"</p>

<p>"Smitty, you're a good average man, a pleasant neighbor, a fine farmer.
I'd like your opinion. Smitty, if you knew a war was coming, would you
help prevent it?"</p>

<p>Althea was watching and listening.</p>

<p>Smitty said, "Hell, yes. Sure."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Smitty. One more thing. What's your opinion of the Rocket?"</p>

<p>"Greatest thing in history. Say, I heard you were going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stanley did not want to get involved. He hurriedly excused himself and
hung up. He looked directly at his wife. "Did you notice the separation
of means from end? Smitty thinks two things. He thinks he can prevent
war; that's one. He thinks the Rocket is a great thing; that's number
two. But they don't match, unfortunately.</p>

<p>"The Rocket isn't a means to happiness the way it'll be used. It's the
wrong means. And with a wrong means you invariably wind up with a
wrong end. A criminal seeks wealth. Does he get it? Temporarily. In the
end, he suffers. All because he took the wrong <i>means</i>." Stanley held
his hands out, uselessly. "How can I make you understand."</p>

<p>Tears were in her eyes. "I understand <i>nothing</i>, and don't need to
understand! Your job, they'll take it away from you and fly the Rocket
anyway!"</p>

<p>"I'll work on the legislation again, then!"</p>

<p>"And perhaps be killed? No, please, Will."</p>

<p>Killed. He looked at his watch. Exactly three.</p>

<p>He answered the audio when it buzzed. "Stanley talking."</p>

<p>"Stanley, this is Cross, at Cal-Tech."</p>

<p>"Cross! Good Lord, it's good to hear you!"</p>

<p>"I just heard the new-flash," said Cross. He had the same clipped,
exact voice he'd had years ago, Stanley realized. "You're really on
the spot this time, aren't you, Will? That's why I called. I like your
ideas on machinery. I've always thought of machines, myself, as nothing
but extensions of man's frustrations and emotions, his losses and
compensations in life. We agree. But you're wrong this time, Will. You
made a mistake today."</p>

<p>"Now, don't <i>you</i> start on me! You're my last friend," retorted Stanley
tiredly. "What else could I do&mdash;destroy the rocket?"</p>

<p>"That would be negative. No good. Give them something positive. Tell
them to go ahead," advised Cross, pleasantly enough. "Warn them, like
a kindly father, of the consequences. Then, when their fingers are
burnt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Humanity might go down the drain," finished Stanley abruptly.</p>

<p>"Not if you play your cards right, control the variables. There must
be some way around them without getting yourself mangled. I'm ready to
help when you have a plan. Think it over."</p>

<p>"I still think blowing the damn thing up would be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'd build a bigger one. And they'd persecute you and your family
the rest of your life," explained Cross logically. "You and I may know
that science hasn't contributed one whit to man's <i>mental</i> progress,
but Mr. Everyman likes his babies diapered in disposable tissues and
likes to travel from Siberia to Johnstown like an infuriated bullet.
You can't stop them, you can only divert them a bit."</p>

<p>Stanley grasped the hand-audio, tightly. He listened.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great roar of 'copters sounded out in the afternoon sky, directly
overhead. The house shook. Althea sprang up lithely and ran to look
out. "I can't talk any more, Cross. I'll call you back. <i>They're</i>
outside, waiting for me, now...."</p>

<p>Cross' voice faded like a dream. "Remember what I tell you. Let them go
ahead."</p>

<p>Stanley walked to the door, opened it, stepped half through.</p>

<p>A radio voice boomed out of the bright blue sky.</p>

<p>"STANLEY!" it shouted. It was Simpson's voice. "STANLEY! COME OUT AND
TALK! COME OUT AND TELL US, STANLEY! STANLEY!"</p>

<p>Althea would not stay in. She walked with him out onto the moist green
lawn, in the open.</p>

<p>The heavens were flooded with 'copters whirling. The sun shook in its
place. 'Copters hung everywhere, like huge hummingbirds, swiveling,
whirring. Five hundred of them, at least, shadowing the lawns and
shaking the house-tops.</p>

<p>"OH, <i>THERE</i> YOUR ARE, STANLEY!"</p>

<p>Stanley shaded his eyes. His lips drew away from his teeth in a
grimace, as he stared upward, tense and afraid.</p>

<p>"IT'S AFTER THREE O'CLOCK, STANLEY!" came the dull boom of words.</p>

<p>In this moment, with the spiraling 'copters suspended over his lawn,
over his wife and children and house, over himself and his beliefs,
Stanley swallowed, stepped back, put his hands down and let the idea
grow within him. Yes, he would give them their rocket. He would give
it to them. You cannot fight the children, he thought. They must have
their green apples. If you refuse them, they will find a way around
you. Go along with their illogical tide and make logic of it. Let the
children eat their full of green apples, many, many green apples to
swell their vast stomach into sickness. Yes. A slow smile touched the
corners of his mouth, vanished. The plan was complete.</p>

<p>The voice from the sky fell on him like an iron fist! "STANLEY! WHAT
IS YOUR WORD NOW? HOW WILL YOU SPEAK NOW? WITH A THOUSAND POUNDS OF
NITROGLYCERINE OVER YOUR HOME, HOW WILL YOU TALK?"</p>

<p>The 'copters sank, malignantly. Thunder swept the lawn. Althea's
brilliant amber skirt flared in the wash of it.</p>

<p>"WILL THE ROCKET FLY, STANLEY?"</p>

<p>From the corners of his aching, straining eyes, Stanley saw his son
poised in the window, watching him.</p>

<p>"RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND AND WAVE IT," thundered the sky-voice. "IF THE
ANSWER IS YES!"</p>

<p>Stanley made them wait for it. He wetted his lips with a slow tongue,
then, gradually, very casually, he raised his right hand, palm up, and
waved it to the thundering sky.</p>

<p>A torrent of exultation poured in a Niagara from the heavens. Five
hundred audios blasted, cheered, exulted! The trees ripped and tore in
the cyclone of energy and explosion! The noise continued as Stanley
turned, took Althea's elbow, and steered her blindly back to the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little black-jet-plane dropped out of the midnight stars. Moments
later, Cross was getting out of it, crossing the dark lawn, grasping
Stanley's hand warmly. "Made good time, eh?"</p>

<p>Inside, they downed their glasses of brandy first, then got to
business. Stanley outlined his plan, his contacts, his psychology. He
was pleased and excited to see an extraordinary smile of approval come
to Cross's pink, round face. "Excellent! Now you're talking!" cried
Cross.</p>

<p>"I like your plan, Stanley. It places the blame right back on the
people. They won't be able to persecute you."</p>

<p>Stanley refilled the glasses. "I'll see to it you're on the Rocket
tomorrow. Greenwald&mdash;he's the captain&mdash;will co-operate, I'm certain,
when the trip is over. It's up to you and Greenwald then."</p>

<p>They raised their glasses. "And when it's all over," observed Cross
slowly. "We'll have the long, hard struggle to revise our educational
system. To begin to apply the scientific method to man's thinking,
instead of just to his machines. And when we've built a logical
subjective world, then it'll be safe to make machines of all and any
kinds. Here's to our plan, may it be completed." They drank.</p>

<p>The next day two million people spread over the rolling hills, through
the tiny Jersey towns, sitting atop bugs and plastic beetles. An
excitement pervaded the day. The sky was a blue vacuum, the 'copters
grounded by law. The Rocket lay gleaming and monstrous and silent.</p>

<p>At noon, the crew ambled across the tarmac, Captain Greenwald leading.
Cross walked among them. The huge metal doors slammed, and with a blast
of Gargantuan flame, the Rocket heaved upward and vanished.</p>

<p>People cheered and laughed and cried.</p>

<p>Stanley watched his son and daughter and mother-in-law do likewise. He
was deeply pleased to see that Althea did not join them. Hand in hand
they watched the sky dazzlement fade. The first Rocket to the moon was
gone. The world was drunkenly happy in its delirium.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed slowly. Astronomers were unable to keep an eye on the
Rocket. It was so small and unaccountable in the void between earth and
lunar surface.</p>

<p>Stanley slept little in the passing of the fourteen days. He was
constantly attacked by fears and confusions of thought. He dreamed of
the Rocket going up. He had seen men month on month walking in the
metal shadow of their wonderful Rocket, patting it with their greasy,
calloused hands, loving it with their quick, appreciative eyes.</p>

<p>If for one moment you let yourself think of it, you loved it, too, for
even though it symbolized wars and destruction, you had to admire its
balance and slenderness of structure. With it, you could rub away the
fog cosmetic of Venus, re-delineate its prehistorically shy face. And
there was Mars, too. Man had been imprisoned a million years. Why not
freedom now, at last?</p>

<p>Then he labeled all these fantasies by their correct name, ESCAPE, and
settled back, to wait the return of the Rocket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The moon Rocket is returning! It will land this morning at nine
o'clock!" Everybody's audio was blatting.</p>

<p>Like a yellow seed, the Rocket dropped down the sky, to sprout roots of
flame on which to cushion itself. It fried the tarmac and a vast deluge
of warm air rushed across the country for miles. People sweltered
amidst a sudden rocket summer.</p>

<p>In his tower room, William Stanley watched, solemn and wordless.</p>

<p>The Rocket shimmered. Across the cooling tarmac, the crowd rioted,
bursting through the barrier, sweeping the police aside in elation.</p>

<p>The tide halted and boiled and changed form, layer upon layer. A vast
hush came upon it.</p>

<p>Now the round air-lock door of the Rocket jetted out air in a
compressed sigh.</p>

<p>The thick door, sandwiched into the ship-hull, took two minutes to
come outward and pull aside on its oiled hingework. The crowd pressed
closer, flesh to flesh, eyes widened. The door was now open completely.
A great cheer went up. The crew of the Moon Rocket stood in the
air-lock. The cheer faded, almost instantly.</p>

    <p><i>The crew of the Moon Rocket stood in the air-lock.</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The crew of the Rocket were not exactly standing. They were hunched
over.</p>

<p>The captain stepped forward. Well, he didn't exactly <i>step</i>. He sort of
dragged his feet and shambled. He made a speech.</p>

<p>But all it sounded like, coming from his twisted, swollen lips, was,
"Uns&mdash;rrrr&mdash;oh&mdash;god&mdash;disss&mdash;ease&mdash;unh&mdash;rrr&mdash;nnn&mdash;"</p>

<p>He held out his grey-green fingers, raw, bleeding, for all to see.
He lifted his face. Those red things, were they actually eyes? That
depression, that fallen socket, had it been a nose? And where were the
teeth in that gagging, hissing mouth? His hair was thin and grey and
infected. He stank.</p>

<p>The hypnotic silence was shattered. The first line of people turned and
clawed at the second line. The second turned instinctively to claw the
third, and so on. The television cameras caught it all.</p>

<p>Screams, yelling, shouting. Many fell and were trampled, crushed
under. The captain and his crew came out, gesturing, calling them to
come back. But who would heed their rotting movements? The ridiculous
souvenir seekers trampled each other, ripping the clothes from one
another's backs!</p>

<p><i>A souvenir? A scab of crawling flesh, a drop of yellow fluid from
their gaping wounds? Souvenirs for earth, buy them right here, get them
while they last! We mail anywhere in the United States!</i></p>

<p><i>The characters in order of appearance: The Captain, the astrogator,
held sagging between two astronomers, who were followed by sixteen
mathematicians, technicians, chemists, biologists, radio men,
geographers and machinists. Shamble forth, gentlemen, and bring the
brave new future with you!</i></p>

<p>The balloon vendor, in flight, jettisoned his entire stock. Rubber
rockets floated wildly, crazily bobbling, bouncing the river of rioting
heads until they were devoured, exploded and crumpled underfoot.</p>

<p>Sirens sounded. Police beetles rushed to the field exits. Ten minutes
later the tarmac was empty. No sign of captain or crew. A few shreds
of their fetid clothing were found, partially disintegrated. An
audio-report five minutes later stated simply, "The captain and crew
were destroyed on orders of the health bureau! An epidemic was feared&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sounds of riot faded. The door to Stanley's office opened, someone
entered and stood behind him, and closed the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stanley did not turn from the window for a moment. "Fifty people
injured, five of them critically. I'm sorry for that. But it was a
small price for the world's security." He turned, slowly.</p>

<p>A horrible creature stood, diseased and swollen, before him. A
captain's uniform, filthy and torn, hung tattered from the disgusting
flesh. The creature opened its bleeding mouth.</p>

<p>"How was it?" asked the creature, muffledly.</p>

<p>"Fine," said Stanley. "Did you reach the moon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the creature. "Captain Greenwald sends his regards to
you. He says he knows we can do it again and again, any time we want,
now, and that's all he wanted to know. He wishes you luck and tells you
to go ahead. We landed the rocket on the way back from the moon, first
of all, up at Fairbanks, Alaska, outside the settlement, naturally,
during the night. Things worked as you planned them. We changed
crews there. There was a minor fight. Simpson and the original crew,
including Captain Greenwald, are still up there, under psycho-hypnosis.
They'll live out their lives happily, unaware, with new names. They
won't remember anything. We took off from Fairbanks again this morning
with the new crew and our act all rehearsed, I think we did all right."</p>

<p>"Where's the substitute crew now?" inquired Stanley.</p>

<p>"Downstairs," said the creature. "Getting psychoed themselves. Getting
mental blocs inserted, so they'll forget they ever fooled the world
today. Then we'll send them back to their regular jobs. Can I use your
shower?"</p>

<p>Stanley pressed a button, a panel slid aside. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>The creature pulled its face around the edges until it shed off into
its hands, a green-grey pallid mask of plastic rubber. The sweating
pink face of Cross appeared. He wriggled his fingers next, until the
green-gray, chemically bleeding horror gloves sucked off. He tossed
these into a wall-incinerator. "The day of the Rocket is over," he
said, quietly. "They'll be putting your bill up before the World
Legislature tomorrow, or I miss my guess. Carefulness, thought and
intellect will now get a start. Humanity is saved from itself."</p>

<p>Stanley watched Cross walk into the shower-cube, peel, and switch on
the spray.</p>

<p>He turned to the window again. Two billion people were thinking
tonight. He knew what they were thinking. Outside, he heard the
explosion as the health department blew up the great Rocket.</p>

<p>That was all. The sound of water on the shower-tiles was a good clean
sound.</p>

<h1>ZERO HOUR</h1>
<p>Oh, it was to be so jolly! What a game! Such excitement they hadn't
known in years. The children catapulted this way and that across the
green lawns, shouting at each other, holding hands, flying in circles,
climbing trees, laughing.... Overhead, the rockets flew and beetle-cars
whispered by on the streets, but the children played on. Such fun, such
tremulous joy, such tumbling and hearty screaming.</p>

<p>Mink ran into the house, all dirt and sweat. For her seven years she
was loud and strong and definite. Her mother, Mrs. Morris, hardly saw
her as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large
sack.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Mink, what's going on?"</p>

<p>"The most exciting game ever!" gasped Mink, pink-faced.</p>

<p>"Stop and get your breath," said the mother.</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right," gasped Mink. "Okay I take these things, Mom?"</p>

<p>"But don't dent them," said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you!" cried Mink and boom! she was gone, like a
rocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris surveyed the fleeing tot. "What's the name of the game?"</p>

<p>"Invasion!" said Mink. The door slammed.</p>

<p>In every yard on the street children brought out knives and forks and
pokers and old stove pipes and can-openers.</p>

<p>It was an interesting fact that this fury and bustle occurred only
among the younger children. The older ones, those ten years and more
disdained the affair and marched scornfully off on hikes or played a
more dignified version of hide-and-seek on their own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, parents came and went in chromium beetles. Repair men
came to repair the vacuum elevators in houses, to fix fluttering
television sets or hammer upon stubborn food-delivery tubes. The
adult civilization passed and repassed the busy youngsters, jealous
of the fierce energy of the wild tots, tolerantly amused at their
flourishings, longing to join in themselves.</p>

<p>"This and this and <i>this</i>," said Mink, instructing the others with
their assorted spoons and wrenches. "Do that, and bring <i>that</i> over
here. No! <i>Here</i>, ninnie! Right. Now, get back while I fix this&mdash;"
Tongue in teeth, face wrinkled in thought. "Like that. See?"</p>

<p>"Yayyyy!" shouted the kids.</p>

<p>Twelve-year-old Joseph Connors ran up.</p>

<p>"Go away," said Mink straight at him.</p>

<p>"I wanna play," said Joseph.</p>

<p>"Can't!" said Mink.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd just make fun of us."</p>

<p>"Honest, I wouldn't."</p>

<p>"No. We know <i>you</i>. Go away or we'll kick you."</p>

<p>Another twelve-year-old boy whirred by on little motor-skates. "Aye,
Joe! Come on! Let them sissies play!"</p>

<p>Joseph showed reluctance and a certain wistfulness. "I <i>want</i> to play,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You're old," said Mink, firmly.</p>

<p>"Not <i>that</i> old," said Joe sensibly.</p>

<p>"You'd only laugh and spoil the Invasion."</p>

<p>The boy on the motor-skates made a rude lip noise. "Come on, Joe! Them
and their fairies! Nuts!"</p>

<p>Joseph walked off slowly. He kept looking back, all down the block.</p>

<p>Mink was already busy again. She made a kind of apparatus with her
gathered equipment. She had appointed another little girl with a pad
and pencil to take down notes in painful slow scribbles. Their voices
rose and fell in the warm sunlight.</p>

<p>All around them the city hummed. The streets were lined with good
green and peaceful trees. Only the wind made a conflict across the
city, across the country, across the continent. In a thousand other
cities there were trees and children and avenues, business men in their
quiet offices taping their voices, or watching televisors. Rockets
hovered like darning needles in the blue sky. There was the universal,
quiet conceit and easiness of men accustomed to peace, quite certain
there would never be trouble again. Arm in arm, men all over earth
were a united front. The perfect weapons were held in equal trust by
all nations. A situation of incredibly beautiful balance had been
brought about. There were no traitors among men, no unhappy ones, no
disgruntled ones; therefore the world was based upon a stable ground.
Sunlight illumined half the world and the trees drowsed in a tide of
warm air.</p>

<p>Mink's mother, from her upstairs window, gazed down.</p>

<p>The children.</p>

<p>She looked upon them and shook her head. Well, they'd eat well, sleep
well, and be in school on Monday. Bless their vigorous little bodies.
She listened.</p>

<p>Mink talked earnestly to someone near the rose-bush&mdash;though there was
no one there.</p>

<p>These odd children. And the little girl, what was her name? Anna? Anna
took notes on a pad. First, Mink asked the rose-bush a question, then
called the answer to Anna.</p>

<p>"Triangle," said Mink.</p>

<p>"What's a tri," said Anna with difficulty, "angle?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mink.</p>

<p>"How you spell it?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"T-R-I-" spelled Mink, slowly, then snapped, "Oh, spell it yourself!"
She went on to other words. "Beam," she said.</p>

<p>"I haven't got tri," said Anna, "angle down yet!"</p>

<p>"Well, hurry, hurry!" cried Mink.</p>

<p>Mink's mother leaned out the upstairs window. "A-N-G-L-E," she spelled
down at Anna.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Mrs. Morris," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mink's mother and withdrew, laughing, to dust the
hall with an electro-duster-magnet.</p>

<p>The voices wavered on the shimmery air. "Beam," said Anna. Fading.</p>

<p>"Four-nine-seven-A-and-B-and-X," said Mink, far away, seriously. "And a
fork and a string and a&mdash;hex-hex-agony ... hexagon<i>al</i>!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At lunch, Mink gulped milk at one toss and was at the door. Her mother
slapped the table.</p>

<p>"You sit right back down," commanded Mrs. Morris. "Hot soup in a
minute." She poked a red button on the kitchen butler and ten seconds
later something landed with a bump in the rubber receiver. Mrs. Morris
opened it, took out a can with a pair of aluminum holders, unsealed it
with a flick and poured hot soup into a bowl.</p>

<p>During all this, Mink fidgeted. "Hurry, Mom! This is a matter of life
and death! Aw&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I was the same way at your age. Always life and death. I know."</p>

<p>Mink banged away at the soup.</p>

<p>"Slow down," said Mom.</p>

<p>"Can't," said Mink. "Drill's waiting for me."</p>

<p>"Who's Drill? What a peculiar name," said Mom.</p>

<p>"You don't know him," said Mink.</p>

<p>"A new boy in the neighborhood?" asked Mom.</p>

<p>"He's new all right," said Mink. She started on her second bowl.</p>

<p>"Which one is Drill?" asked Mom.</p>

<p>"He's around," said Mink, evasively. "You'll make fun. Everybody pokes
fun. Gee, darn."</p>

<p>"Is Drill shy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. No. In a way. Gosh, Mom, I got to run if we want to have the
Invasion!"</p>

<p>"Who's invading what?"</p>

<p>"Martians invading Earth&mdash;well, not exactly Martians. They're&mdash;I don't
know. From up." She pointed with her spoon.</p>

<p>"And <i>inside</i>," said Mom, touching Mink's feverish brow.</p>

<p>Mink rebelled. "You're laughing! You'll kill Drill and <i>every</i>body."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to," said Mom. "Drill's a Martian?"</p>

<p>"No. He's&mdash;well&mdash;maybe from Jupiter or Saturn or Venus. Anyway, he's
had a hard time."</p>

<p>"I imagine." Mrs. Morris hid her mouth behind her hand.</p>

<p>"They couldn't figure a way to attack earth."</p>

<p>"We're impregnable," said Mom, in mock-seriousness.</p>

<p>"That's the word Drill used! Impreg&mdash;That was the word, Mom."</p>

<p>"My, my. Drill's a brilliant little boy. Two-bit words."</p>

<p>"They couldn't figure a way to attack, Mom. Drill says&mdash;he says in
order to make a good fight you got to have a new way of surprising
people. That way you win. And he says also you got to have help from
your enemy."</p>

<p>"A fifth column," said Mom.</p>

<p>"Yeah. That's what Drill said. And they couldn't figure a way to
surprise Earth or get help."</p>

<p>"No wonder. We're pretty darn strong," laughed Mom, cleaning up. Mink
sat there, staring at the table, seeing what she was talking about.</p>

<p>"Until, one day," whispered Mink, melodramatically, "they thought of
children!"</p>

<p>"<i>Well!</i>" said Mrs. Morris brightly.</p>

<p>"And they thought of how grown-ups are so busy they never look under
rose-bushes or on lawns!"</p>

<p>"Only for snails and fungus."</p>

<p>"And then there's something about dim-dims."</p>

<p>"Dim-dims?"</p>

<p>"Dimens-shuns."</p>

<p>"Dimensions?"</p>

<p>"Four of 'em! And there's something about kids under nine and
imagination. It's real funny to hear Drill talk."</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris was tired. "Well, it must be funny. You're keeping Drill
waiting now. It's getting late in the day and, if you want to have your
Invasion before your supper bath, you'd better jump."</p>

<p>"Do I have to take a bath?" growled Mink.</p>

<p>"You do. Why is it children hate water? No matter what age you live in
children hate water behind the ears!"</p>

<p>"Drill says I won't have to take baths," said Mink.</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he?"</p>

<p>"He told all the kids that. No more baths. And we can stay up till ten
o'clock and go to two televisor shows on Saturday 'stead of one!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Drill better mind his p's and q's. I'll call up his mother
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mink went to the door. "We're having trouble with guys like Pete Britz
and Dale Jerrick. They're growing up. They make fun. They're worse than
parents. They just won't believe in Drill. They're so snooty, cause
they're growing up. You'd think they'd know better. They were little
only a coupla years ago. I hate them worst. We'll kill them <i>first</i>."</p>

<p>"Your father and I, last?"</p>

<p>"Drill says you're dangerous. Know why? Cause you don't believe in
Martians! They're going to let <i>us</i> run the world. Well, not just us,
but the kids over in the next block, too. I might be queen." She opened
the door. "Mom?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;lodge ... ick?"</p>

<p>"Logic? Why, dear, logic is knowing what things are true and not true."</p>

<p>"He <i>mentioned</i> that," said Mink. "And what's im&mdash;pres&mdash;sion&mdash;able?" It
took her a minute to say it.</p>

<p>"Why, it means&mdash;" Her mother looked at the floor, laughing gently. "It
means&mdash;to be a child, dear."</p>

<p>"Thanks for lunch!" Mink ran out, then stuck her head back in. "Mom,
I'll be sure you won't be hurt, much, really!"</p>

<p>"Well, thanks," said Mom.</p>

<p><i>Slam</i> went the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At four o'clock the audio-visor buzzed. Mrs. Morris flipped the tab.
"Hello, Helen!" she said, in welcome.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mary. How are things in New York?"</p>

<p>"Fine, how are things in Scranton? You look tired."</p>

<p>"So do you. The children. Underfoot," said Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris sighed, "My Mink, too. The super Invasion."</p>

<p>Helen laughed. "Are your kids playing that game, too?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes. Tomorrow it'll be geometrical jacks and motorized
hopscotch. Were we this bad when we were kids in '48?"</p>

<p>"Worse. Japs and Nazis. Don't know how my parents put up with me.
Tomboy."</p>

<p>"Parents learn to shut their ears."</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Mary?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris' eyes were half-closed; her tongue slid slowly,
thoughtfully over her lower lip. "Eh," She jerked. "Oh, nothing. Just
thought about <i>that</i>. Shutting ears and such. Never mind. Where were
we?"</p>

<p>"My boy Tim's got a crush on some guy named&mdash;<i>Drill</i>, I think it was."</p>

<p>"Must be a new password. Mink likes him, too."</p>

<p>"Didn't know it got as far as New York. Word of mouth, I imagine. Looks
like a scrap drive. I talked to Josephine and she said her kids&mdash;that's
in Boston&mdash;are wild on this new game. It's sweeping the country."</p>

<p>At this moment, Mink trotted into the kitchen to gulp a glass of water.
Mrs. Morris turned. "How're things going?"</p>

<p>"Almost finished," said Mink.</p>

<p>"Swell," said Mrs. Morris. "What's <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"A yo-yo," said Mink. "Watch."</p>

<p>She flung the yo-yo down its string. Reaching the end it&mdash;</p>

<p>It vanished.</p>

<p>"See?" said Mink. "Ope!" Dibbling her finger she made the yo-yo
reappear and zip up the string.</p>

<p>"Do that again," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Can't. Zero hour's five o'clock! 'Bye."</p>

<p>Mink exited, zipping her yo-yo.</p>

<p>On the audio-visor, Helen laughed. "Tim brought one of those yo-yo's in
this morning, but when I got curious he said he wouldn't show it to me,
and when I tried to work it, finally, it wouldn't work."</p>

<p>"You're not <i>impressionable</i>," said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Something I thought of. Can I help you, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to get that black-and-white cake recipe&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The hour drowsed by. The day waned. The sun lowered in the peaceful
blue sky. Shadows lengthened on the green lawns. The laughter and
excitement continued. One little girl ran away, crying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris came out the front door.</p>

<p>"Mink, was that Peggy Ann crying?"</p>

<p>Mink was bent over in the yard, near the rose-bush. "Yeah. She's a
scarebaby. We won't let her play, now. She's getting too old to play. I
guess she grew up all of a sudden."</p>

<p>"Is that why she cried? Nonsense. Give me a civil answer, young lady,
or inside you come!"</p>

<p>Mink whirled in consternation, mixed with irritation. "I can't quit
now. It's almost time. I'll be good. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Did you hit Peggy Ann?"</p>

<p>"No, honest. You ask her. It was something&mdash;well, she's just a
scaredy-pants."</p>

<p>The ring of children drew in around Mink where she scowled at her work
with spoons and a kind of square shaped arrangement of hammers and
pipes. "There and there," murmured Mink.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" said Mrs. Morris.</p>

<p>"Drill's stuck. Half way. If we could only get him all the way through,
it'll be easier. Then all the others could come through after him."</p>

<p>"Can I help?"</p>

<p>"No'm, thanks. I'll fix it."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll call you for your bath in half an hour. I'm tired of
watching you."</p>

<p>She went in and sat in the electric-relaxing chair, sipping a little
beer from a half-empty glass. The chair massaged her back. Children,
children. Children and love and hate, side by side. Sometimes children
loved you, hated you, all in half a second. Strange children, did they
ever forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of
command? She wondered. How can you ever forget or forgive those over
and above you, those tall and silly dictators?</p>

<p>Time passed. A curious, waiting silence came upon the street, deepening.</p>

<p>Five o'clock. A clock sang softly somewhere in the house, in a quiet,
musical voice, "Five o'clock ... five o'clock. Time's a wasting. Five
o'clock," and purred away into silence.</p>

<p>Zero hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris chuckled in her throat. Zero hour.</p>

<p>A beetle-car hummed into the driveway. Mr. Morris. Mrs. Morris smiled.
Mr. Morris got out of the beetle, locked it and called hello to Mink at
her work. Mink ignored him. He laughed and stood for a moment watching
the children in their business. Then he walked up the front steps.</p>

<p>"Hello, darling."</p>

<p>"Hello, Henry."</p>

<p>She strained forward on the edge of the chair, listening. The children
were silent. Too silent.</p>

<p>He emptied his pipe, refilled it. "Swell day. Makes you glad to be
alive."</p>

<p>Buzz.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"I don't know." She got up, suddenly, her eyes widening. She was going
to say something. She stopped it. Ridiculous. Her nerves jumped. "Those
children haven't anything dangerous out there, have they?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nothing but pipes and hammers. Why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing electrical?"</p>

<p>"Heck, no," said Henry. "I looked."</p>

<p>She walked to the kitchen. The buzzing continued. "Just the same
you'd better go tell them to quit. It's after five. Tell them&mdash;" Her
eyes widened and narrowed. "Tell them to put off their Invasion until
tomorrow." She laughed, nervously.</p>

<p>The buzzing grew louder.</p>

<p>"What are they up to? I'd better go look, all right."</p>

<p>The explosion!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The house shook with dull sound. There were other explosions in other
yards on other streets.</p>

<p>Involuntarily, Mrs. Morris screamed. "Up this way!" she cried,
senselessly, knowing no sense, no reason. Perhaps she saw something
from the corners of her eyes, perhaps she smelled a new odor or heard
a new noise. There was no time to argue with Henry to convince him.
Let him think her insane. Yes, insane! Shrieking, she ran upstairs. He
ran after her to see what she was up to. "In the attic!" she screamed.
"That's where it is!" It was only a poor excuse to get him in the attic
in time&mdash;oh God, in time!</p>

<p>Another explosion outside. The children screamed with delight, as if at
a great fireworks display.</p>

<p>"It's not in the attic!" cried Henry. "It's outside!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Wheezing, gasping, she fumbled at the attic door. "I'll show
you. Hurry! I'll show you!"</p>

<p>They tumbled into the attic. She slammed the door, locked it, took the
key, threw it into a far, cluttered corner.</p>

<p>She was babbling wild stuff now. It came out of her. All the
subconscious suspicion and fear that had gathered secretly all
afternoon and fermented like a wine in her. All the little revelations
and knowledges and sense that had bothered her all day and which she
had logically and carefully and sensibly rejected and censored. Now it
exploded in her and shook her to bits.</p>

<p>"There, there," she said, sobbing against the door. "We're safe until
tonight. Maybe we can sneak out, maybe we can escape!"</p>

<p>Henry blew up, too, but for another reason. "Are you crazy? Why'd you
throw that key away! Damn it, honey!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm crazy, if it helps, but stay here with me!"</p>

<p>"I don't know how in hell I <i>can</i> get out!"</p>

<p>"Quiet. They'll hear us. Oh, God, they'll find us soon enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>Below them, Mink's voice. The husband stopped. There was a great
universal humming and sizzling, a screaming and giggling. Downstairs,
the audio-televisor buzzed and buzzed insistently, alarmingly,
violently. <i>Is that Helen calling?</i> thought Mrs. Morris. <i>And is she
calling about what I</i> think <i>she's calling about</i>?</p>

<p>Footsteps came into the house. Heavy footsteps.</p>

<p>"Who's coming in my house?" demanded Henry, angrily. "Who's tramping
around down there?"</p>

<p>Heavy feet. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty of them. Fifty persons
crowding into the house. The humming. The giggling of the children.
"This way!" cried Mink, below.</p>

<p>"Who's downstairs?" roared Henry. "Who's there!"</p>

<p>"Hush, oh, nonononono!" said his wife, weakly, holding him. "Please, be
quiet. They might go away."</p>

<p>"Mom?" called Mink, "Dad?" A pause. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>Heavy footsteps, heavy, heavy, <i>very</i> HEAVY footsteps came up the
stairs. Mink leading them.</p>

<p>"Mom?" A hesitation. "Dad?" A waiting, a silence.</p>

<p>Humming. Footsteps toward the attic. Mink's first.</p>

<p>They trembled together in silence in the attic, Mr. and Mrs. Morris.
For some reason the electric humming, the queer cold light suddenly
visible under the door crack, the strange odor and the alien sound of
eagerness in Mink's voice, finally got through to Henry Morris, too. He
stood, shivering, in the dark silence, his wife beside him.</p>

<p>"Mom! Dad!"</p>

<p>Footsteps. A little humming sound. The attic lock melted. The door
opened. Mink peered inside, tall blue shadows behind her.</p>

<p>"Peek-a-boo," said Mink.</p>

<h1>Jonah of the Jove-Run</h1>
<p>Nibley stood in the changing shadows and sounds of Marsport, watching
the great supply ship TERRA being entered and left by a number of
officials and mechanics. Something had happened. Something was wrong.
There were a lot of hard faces and not much talk. There was a bit of
swearing and everybody looked up at the night sky of Mars, waiting.</p>

<p>But nobody came to Nibley for his opinion or his help. He stood there,
a very old man, with a slack-gummed face and eyes like the little
bubbly stalks of crayfish looking up at you from a clear creek. He
stood there fully neglected. He stood there and talked to himself.</p>

<p>"They don't want me, or need me," he said. "Machines are better,
nowadays. Why should they want an old man like me with a taste for
Martian liquor? They shouldn't! A machine isn't old and foolish, and
doesn't get drunk!"</p>

<p>Way out over the dead sea bottoms, Nibley sensed something moving. Part
of himself was suddenly awake and sensitive. His small sharp eyes moved
in his withered face. Something inside of his small skull reacted and
he shivered. He <i>knew</i>. He knew that what these men were watching and
waiting for would never come.</p>

<p>Nibley edged up to one of the astrogators from the TERRA. He touched
him on the shoulder. "Say," he said. "I'm busy," said the astrogator.
"I know," said Nibley, "but if you're waiting for that small repair
rocket to come through with the extra auxiliary asteroid computator on
it, you're wasting your time."</p>

<p>"Like hell," said the astrogator, glaring at the old man. "That repair
rocket's got to come through, and quick; we need it. It'll get here."</p>

<p>"No, it won't," said Nibley, sadly, and shook his head and closed his
eyes. "It just crashed, a second ago, out on the dead sea bottom.
I&mdash;<i>felt</i>&mdash;it crash. I sensed it going down. It'll never come through."</p>

<p>"Go away, old man," said the astrogator. "I don't want to hear that
kind of talk. It'll come through. Sure, sure, it has to come through."
The astrogator turned away and looked at the sky, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I know it as a fact," said Nibley, but the young astrogator wouldn't
listen. He didn't want to hear the truth. The truth was not a pleasant
thing. Nibley went on, to himself. "I know it for a fact, just like
I was always able to know the course of meteors with my mind, or the
orbits or parabolas of asteroids. I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The men stood around waiting and smoking. They didn't know yet about
the crash out there. Nibley felt a great sorrow rise in himself for
them. That ship meant a great deal to them and now it had crashed.
Perhaps their lives had crashed with it.</p>

<p>A loud speaker on the outer area of the landing tarmac opened out with
a voice: "Attention, crew of the Terra. The repair ship just radioed in
a report that it has been fired upon from somewhere over the dead seas.
It crashed a minute ago."</p>

<p>The report was so sudden and quiet and matter-of-fact that the standing
smoking men did not for a moment understand it.</p>

<p>Then, each in his own way, they reacted to it. Some of them ran for
the radio building to verify the report. Others sat down and put their
hands over their faces. Still more of them stood staring at the sky as
if staring might put the repair ship back together again and get it
here safe and intact. Instinctively, at last, all of them looked up at
the sky.</p>

<p>Jupiter was there, with its coterie of moons, bright and far away.
Part of their lives lived on Jupiter. Most of them had children and
wives there and certain duties to perform to insure the longevity
of said children and wives. Now, with the speaking of a few words
over a loudspeaker, the distance to Jupiter was suddenly an immense
impossibility.</p>

<p>The captain of the Rocket Terra walked across the field slowly. He
stopped several times to try and light a cigarette, but the night wind
blew it out. He stood in the rocket shadow and looked up at Jupiter and
swore quietly, again and again and finally threw down his cigarette and
heeled it with his shoe.</p>

<p>Nibley walked up and stood beside the captain.</p>

<p>"Captain Kroll...."</p>

<p>Kroll turned. "Oh, hello, Grandpa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tough luck."</p>

<p>"Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's what you'd call it. Tough luck."</p>

<p>"You're going to take off anyway, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Kroll quietly, looking at the sky. "Sure."</p>

<p>"How's the protective computator on board your ship?"</p>

<p>"Not so hot. Bad, in fact. It might conk out before we get half way
through the asteroids."</p>

<p>"That's not good," said Nibley.</p>

<p>"It's lousy. I feel sick. I need a drink. I wish I was dead. I wish
we'd never started this damned business of being damned pioneers. My
family's up there!" He jerked his hand half way to Jupiter, violently.
He settled down and tried to light another cigarette. No go. He threw
it down after the other.</p>

<p>"Can't get through the asteroids without an asteroid computator to
protect you, without that old radar set-up, captain," said Nibley,
blinking wetly. He shuffled his small feet around in the red dust.</p>

<p>"We had an auxiliary computator on that repair ship coming from Earth,"
said Kroll, standing there. "And it had to crash."</p>

<p>"The Martians shoot it down, you think?"</p>

<p>"Sure. They don't like us going up to Jupiter. They got claims there,
too. They'd like to see our colony die out. Best way to kill a colony
is starve the colony. Starve the people. That means my family and lots
of families. Then when you starve out the families the Martians can
step in and take over, damn their filthy souls!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kroll fell silent Nibley shifted around. He walked around in front of
Kroll so Kroll would see him. "Captain?"</p>

<p>Kroll didn't even look at him.</p>

<p>Nibley said, "Maybe I can help."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"You heard about me, captain! You heard about me."</p>

<p>"What about you?"</p>

<p>"You can't wait a month for another auxiliary computator to come
through from Earth. You got to push off tonight, to Jupiter, to get to
your family and the colony and all that, captain, sure!" Nibley was
hasty, he sort of fidgeted around, his voice high, and excited. "An' if
your only computator conks out in the middle of the asteroids, well,
you know what that means. Bang! No more ship! No more you. No more
colony on Jupiter! Now, you know about me, my ability, you know, you
heard."</p>

<p>Kroll was cool and quiet and far away. "I heard about you, old man. I
heard lots. They say you got a funny brain and do things machines can't
do. I don't know. I don't like the idea."</p>

<p>"But you got to like the idea, captain. I'm the only one can help you
now!"</p>

<p>"I don't trust you. I heard about your drinking that time and wrecking
that ship. I remember that."</p>

<p>"But I'm not drinking now. See. Smell my breath, go ahead! You see?"</p>

<p>Kroll stood there. He looked at the ship and he looked at the sky and
then at Nibley. Finally he sighed. "Old man, I'm leaving right now. I
might just as well take you along as leave you. You might do some good.
What can I lose?"</p>

<p>"Not a damned thing, Captain, and you won't be sorry," cried Nibley.</p>

<p>"Step lively, then!"</p>

<p>They went to the Rocket, Kroll running, Nibley hobbling along after.</p>

<p>Trembling excitedly, Nibley stumbled into the Rocket. Everything had a
hot mist over it. First time on a rocket in&mdash;ten years, by god. Good.
Good to be aboard again. He smelled it. It smelled fine. It felt fine.
Oh, it was very fine indeed. First time since that trouble he got into
off the planet Venus ... he brushed that thought away. That was over
and past.</p>

<p>He followed Kroll up through the ship to a small room in the prow.</p>

<p>Men ran up and down the rungs. Men who had families out there on
Jupiter and were willing to go through the asteroids with a faulty
radar set-up to reach those families and bring them the necessary cargo
of machinery and food they needed to go on.</p>

<p>Out of a warm mist, old Nibley heard himself being introduced to a
third man in the small room.</p>

<p>"Douglas, this is Nibley, our auxiliary computating machine."</p>

<p>"A poor time for joking, Captain."</p>

<p>"It's no joke," cried Nibley. "Here I am."</p>

<p>Douglas eyed Nibley with a very cold and exact eye. "No," he said. "No.
I can't use him. I'm computant-mechanic."</p>

<p>"And I'm captain," said Kroll.</p>

<p>Douglas looked at Kroll. "We'll shove through to Jupiter with just our
leaky set of radar-computators; that's the way it'll have to be. If
we're wrecked halfway, well, we're wrecked. But I'll be damned if I go
along with a decrepit son-of-a-witch-doctor!"</p>

<p>Nibley's eyes watered. He sucked in on himself. There was a pain round
his heart and he was suddenly chilled.</p>

<p>Kroll started to speak, but a gong rattled and banged and a voice
shouted, "Stations! Gunners up! Hammocks! Takeoff!"</p>

<p>"<i>Takeoff!</i>"</p>

<p>"Stay here!" Kroll snapped it at the old man. He leaped away and down
the rungs of the ladder, leaving Nibley alone in the broad shadow
of the bitter-eyed Douglas. Douglas looked him up and down in surly
contempt. "So you know arcs, parabolas and orbits as good as my
machines, do you?"</p>

<p>Nibley nodded, angry now that Kroll was gone:</p>

<p>"Machines," shrilled Nibley. "Can't do everything! They ain't got no
intuition. Can't understand sabotage and hatreds and arguments. Or
people. Machines're too damn slow!"</p>

<p>Douglas lidded his eyes. "You&mdash;<i>you're</i> faster?"</p>

<p>"I'm faster," said Nibley.</p>

<p>Douglas flicked his cigarette toward a wall-disposal slot.</p>

<p>"Predict that orbit!"</p>

<p>Nibley's eyes jerked. "Gonna miss it!"</p>

<p>The cigarette lay smouldering on the deck.</p>

<p>Douglas scowled at the cigarette.</p>

<p>Nibley made wheezy laughter. He minced to his shock-hammock, zipped
into it. "Not bad, not bad, eh?"</p>

<p>The ship rumbled.</p>

<p>Angrily, Douglas snatched up the cigarette, carried it to his own
hammock, rolled in, zipped the zipper, then, deliberately, he flicked
the cigarette once more. It flew.</p>

<p>"Another miss," predicted Nibley.</p>

<p>Douglas was still glaring at the floored cigarette when the Rocket
burst gravity and shot up into space toward the asteroids.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mars dwindled into the sun. Asteroids swept silently down the
star-tracks, all metal, all invisible, shifting and shifting to harry
the Rocket&mdash;</p>

<p>Nibley sprawled by the great thick visiport feeling the computators
giving him competition under the floor in the level below, predicting
meteors and correcting the Terra's course accordingly.</p>

<p>Douglas stood behind Nibley, stiff and quiet. Since he was
computant-mechanic, Nibley was his charge. He was to protect Nibley
from harm. Kroll had said so. Douglas didn't like it at all.</p>

<p>Nibley was feeling fine. It was like the old days. It was good. He
laughed. He waved at nothing outside the port. "Hi, there!" he called.
"Meteor," he explained in an aside to Douglas. "You see it?"</p>

<p>"Lives at stake and you sit there playing."</p>

<p>"Nope. Not playin'. Just warmin' up. I can see 'em beatin' like hell
all up and down the line, son. God's truth."</p>

<p>"Kroll's a damned fool," said Douglas. "Sure, you had a few lucky
breaks in the old days before they built a good computator. A few lucky
breaks and you lived off them. Your day's done."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>still</i> good."</p>

<p>"How about the time you swilled a quart of rot-gut and almost killed a
cargo of civilian tourists? I heard about that. All I have to say is
one word and your ears'd twitch. Whiskey."</p>

<p>At the word, saliva ran alarmingly in Nibley's mouth. He swallowed
guiltily. Douglas, snorting, turned and started from the room. Nibley
grabbed a monkey-wrench on impulse, heaved it. The wrench hit the wall
and fell down. Nibley wheezed, "Wrench got an orbit like everything.
Fair bit of computation I did. One point over and I'd have flanked that
crumb!"</p>

<p>There was silence now, as he hobbled back and sat wearily to stare
into the stars. He felt all of the ship's men around him. Vague warm
electrical stirrings of fear, hope, dismay, exhaustion. All their
orbits coming into a parallel trajectory now. All living in the same
path with him. And the asteroids smashed down with an increasing
swiftness. In a very few hours the main body of missiles would be
encountered.</p>

<p>Now, as he stared into space he felt a dark orbit coming into
conjunction with his own. It was an unpleasant orbit. One that touched
him with fear. It drew closer. It was dark. It was very close now.</p>

<p>A moment later a tall man in a black uniform climbed the rungs from
below and stood looking at Nibley.</p>

<p>"I'm Bruno," he said. He was a nervous fellow, and kept looking around,
looking around, at the walls, the deck, at Nibley. "I'm food specialist
on board. How come you're up here? Come down to mess later. Join me in
a game of Martian chess."</p>

<p>Nibley said, "I'd beat the hell out of you. Wouldn't pay. It's against
orders for me to be down below, anyways."</p>

<p>"How come?"</p>

<p>"Never you never mind. Got things to do up here. I <i>notice</i> things.
I'm chartin' a special course in a special way. Even Captain Kroll
don't know <i>every</i> reason why I'm makin' this trip. Got my own personal
reasons. I see 'em comin' and goin', and I got their orbits picked neat
and dandy. Meteors, planets <i>and</i> men. Why, let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bruno tensed somewhat forward. His face was a little too interested.
Nibley didn't like the feel of the man. He was off-trajectory.
He&mdash;smelled&mdash;funny. He <i>felt</i> funny.</p>

<p>Nibley shut up. "Nice day," he said.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Bruno. "You were saying?"</p>

<p>Douglas stepped up the rungs. Bruno cut it short, saluted Douglas, and
left.</p>

<p>Douglas watched him go, coldly. "What'd Bruno want?" he asked of the
old man. "Captain's orders, you're to see <i>nobody</i>."</p>

<p>Nibley's wrinkles made a smile. "Watch that guy Bruno. I got his orbit
fixed all round and arced. I see him goin' now, and I see him reachin'
aphelion and I see him comin' back."</p>

<p>Douglas pulled his lip. "You think Bruno might be working for the
Martian industrial <i>clique</i>? If I thought he had anything to do with
stopping us from getting to the Jovian colony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He'll be back," said Nibley. "Just before we reach the <i>heavy</i>
Asteroid Belt. Wait and see."</p>

<p>The ship swerved. The computators had just dodged a meteor. Douglas
smiled. That griped Nibley. The machines were stealing his feathers.
Nibley paused and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Here come two more meteors! I beat the machine this time!"</p>

<p>They waited. The ship swerved, twice.</p>

<p>"Damn it," said Douglas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two hours passed. "It got lonely upstairs," said Nibley apologetically.</p>

<p>Captain Kroll glanced nervously up from the mess-table where he and
twelve other men sat. Williams, Simpson, Haines, Bruno, McClure,
Leiber, and the rest. All were eating, but not hungry. They all looked
a little sick. The ship was swerving again and again, steadily,
steadily, back and forth. In a short interval the Heavy Belt would be
touched. Then there would be real sickness.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Kroll to Nibley. "You can eat with us, this once. And only
this once, remember that."</p>

<p>Nibley ate like a starved weasel. Bruno looked over at him again and
again and finally asked, "How about that chess game?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I always win. Don't want to brag but I was the best outfielder
playing baseball when I was at school. Never struck out at bat,
neither. Damn good."</p>

<p>Bruno cut a piece of meat. "What's your business now, Gramps?"</p>

<p>"Findin' out where things is goin'," evaded Nibley.</p>

<p>Kroll snapped his gaze at Nibley. The old man hurried on, "Why, I know
where the whole blamed universe is headin'." Everybody looked up from
their eating. "But you wouldn't believe me if I told you," laughed the
old man.</p>

<p>Somebody whistled. Others chuckled. Kroll relaxed. Bruno scowled.
Nibley continued, "It's a feelin'. You can't describe stars to a blind
man, or God to anybody. Why, hell's bells, lads, if I wanted I could
write a formula on paper and if you worked it out in your mind you'd
drop dead of symbol poison."</p>

<p>Again laughter. A bit of wine was poured all around as a bracer for
the hours ahead. Nibley eyed the forbidden stuff and got up. "Well, I
got to go." "Have some wine," said Bruno. "No, thanks," said Nibley.
"Go ahead, have some," said Bruno. "I don't like it," said Nibley,
wetting his lips. "That's a laugh," said Bruno, eyeing him. "I got to
go upstairs. Nice to have ate with you boys. See you later, after we
get through the Swarms&mdash;"</p>

<p>Faces became wooden at the mention of the approaching Belt. Fingers
tightened against the table edge. Nibley spidered back up the rungs to
his little room alone.</p>

<p>An hour later, Nibley was drunk as a chromium-plated pirate.</p>

<p>He kept it a secret. He hid the wine-bottle in his shock-hammock,
groggily. Stroke of luck. Oh yes, oh yes, a stroke, a stroke of luck,
yes, yes, yes, finding that lovely fine wonderful wine in the storage
cabinet near the visiport. Why, yes! And since he'd been thirsty for so
long, so long, so long. Well? Gurgle, gurgle!</p>

<p>Nibley was drunk.</p>

<p>He swayed before the visiport, drunkenly deciding the trajectories of
a thousand invisible nothings. Then he began to argue with himself,
drowsily, as he always argued when wine-webs were being spun through
his skull by red, drowsy spiders. His heart beat dully. His little
sharp eyes flickered with sudden flights of anger.</p>

<p>"You're some liar, Mr. Nibley," he told himself. "You point at meteors,
but who's to prove you right or wrong, right or wrong, eh? You sit up
here and wait and wait and wait. Those machines down below spoil it.
You never have a chance to prove your ability! No! The captain won't
use you! He won't need you! None of those men believe in you. Think
you're a liar. Laugh at you. Yes, laugh. Yes, they call you an old, old
liar!"</p>

<p>Nibley's thin nostrils quivered. His thin wrinkled face was crimsoned
and wild. He staggered to his feet, got hold of his favorite
monkey-wrench and waved it slowly back and forth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a moment his heart almost stopped in him. In panic he clutched at
his chest, pushing, pulling, pumping at his heart to keep it running.
The wine. The excitement. He dropped the wrench. "No, not yet!" he
looked down at his chest, wildly tearing at it. "Not just yet, oh
please!" he cried. "Not until I <i>show</i> them!"</p>

<p>His heart went on beating, drunkenly, slowly.</p>

<p>He bent, retrieved the wrench and laughed numbly. "I'll show 'em," he
cried, weaving across the deck. "Show them how good I am. Eliminate
competition! I'll run the ship myself!"</p>

<p>He climbed slowly down the rungs to destroy the machines.</p>

<p>It made a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Nibley heard a shout. "Get him!" His hand went down again, again. There
was a scream of whistles, a jarring of flung metal, a minor explosion.
His hand went down again, the wrench in it. He felt himself cursing
and pounding away. Something shattered. Men ran toward him. <i>This</i> was
the computator! He hit upon it once more. Yes! Then he was caught up
like an empty sack, smashed in the face by someone's fist, thrown to
the deck. "Cut acceleration!" a voice cried far away. The ship slowed.
Somebody kicked Nibley in the face. Blackness. Dark. Around and around
down into darkness....</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again people were talking:</p>

<p>"We're turning back."</p>

<p>"The hell we are. Kroll says we'll go on, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's suicide! We can't hit that Asteroid Belt without radar."</p>

<p>Nibley looked up from the floor. Kroll was there, over him, looking
down at the old man. "I might have known," he said, over and over
again. He wavered in Nibley's sobering vision.</p>

<p>The ship hung motionless, silent. Through the ports, Nibley saw they
were based on the sunward side of a large planetoid, waiting, shielded
from most of the asteroid particles.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Nibley.</p>

<p>"He's sorry." Kroll swore. "The very man we bring along as relief
computator sabotages our machine! Hell!"</p>

<p>Bruno was in the room. Nibley saw Bruno's eyes dilate at Kroll's
exclamation. Bruno knew now.</p>

<p>Nibley tried to get up. "We'll get through the Swarm, anyway. I'll take
you through. That's why I broke that blasted contraption. I don't like
competition. I can clear a path through them asteroids big enough to
lug Luna through on Track Five!"</p>

<p>"Who gave you the wine?"</p>

<p>"I found it, I just found it, that's all."</p>

<p>The crew hated him with their eyes. He felt their hatred like so many
meteors coming in and striking at him. They hated his shriveled,
wrinkled old man guts. They stood around and waited for Kroll to let
them kick him apart with their boots.</p>

<p>Kroll walked around the old man in a circle. "You think I'd chance you
getting us through the Belt!" He snorted. "What if we got half through
and you got potted again!" He stopped, with his back to Nibley. He was
thinking. He kept looking over his shoulder at the old man. "I can't
trust you." He looked out the port at the stars, at where Jupiter shone
in space. "And yet&mdash;" He looked at the men. "Do you want to turn back?"</p>

<p>Nobody moved. They didn't have to answer. They didn't want to go back.
They wanted to go ahead.</p>

<p>"We'll keep on going, then," said Kroll.</p>

<p>Bruno spoke. "We crew-members should have some say. I say go back. We
can't make it. We're just wasting our lives."</p>

<p>Kroll glanced at him, coolly. "You seem to be alone." He went back to
the port. He rocked on his heels. "It was no accident Nibley got that
wine. Somebody planted it, knowing Nibley's weakness. Somebody who
was paid off by the Martian Industrials to keep this ship from going
through. This was a clever set-up. The machines were smashed in such
a way as to throw suspicion directly on an innocent, well, almost
innocent, party. Nibley was just a tool. I'd like to know who handled
that tool&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nibley got up, the wrench in his gnarled hand. "I'll tell you who
planted that wine. I been thinking and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>Darkness. A short-circuit. Feet running on the metal deck. A shout. A
thread of fire across the darkness. Then a whistling as something flew,
hit. Someone grunted.</p>

<p>The lights came on again. Nibley was at the light control.</p>

<p>On the floor, gun in hand, eyes beginning to numb, lay Bruno. He lifted
the gun, fired it. The bullet hit Nibley in the stomach.</p>

<p>Nibley grabbed at the pain. Kroll kicked at Bruno's head. Bruno's head
snapped back. He lay quietly.</p>

<p>The blood pulsed out between Nibley's fingers. He watched it with
interest, grinning with pain. "I knew his orbit," he whispered, sitting
down cross-legged on the deck. "When the lights went out I chose my own
orbit back to the light switch. I knew where Bruno'd be in the dark.
Havin' a wrench handy I let fly, choosin' my arc, naturally. Guess he's
got a hard skull, though...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They carried Nibley to a bunk. Douglas stood over him, dimly, growing
older every second. Nibley squinted up. All the men tightened in upon
it. Nibley felt their dismay, their dread, their worry, their nervous
anger.</p>

<p>Finally, Kroll exhaled. "Turn the ship around," he said. "Go back to
Mars."</p>

<p>The crew stood with their limp hands at their sides. They were tired.
They didn't want to live any more. They just stood with their feet on
the deck. Then, one by one, they began to walk away like so many cold,
dead men.</p>

<p>"Hold on," cried Nibley, weakening. "I ain't through yet. I got two
orbits to fix. I got one to lay out for this ship to Jupiter. And I got
to finish out my own separate secret personal orbit. You ain't turnin'
back nowhere!"</p>

<p>Kroll grimaced. "Might as well realize it, Grandpa. It takes seven
hours to get through the Swarms, and you haven't another <i>two</i> hours in
you."</p>

<p>The old man laughed. "Think I don't know that? Hell! Who's supposed to
know all these things, me or you?"</p>

<p>"You, Pop."</p>

<p>"Well, then, dammit&mdash;bring me a bulger!"</p>

<p>"Now, look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You heard me, by God&mdash;a bulger!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You ever hear of a thing called triangulation? Well, maybe I won't
live long enough to go with you, but, by all the sizes and shapes of
behemoths&mdash;this ship is jumpin' through to Jupiter!"</p>

<p>Kroll looked at him. There was a breathing silence, a heart beating
silence in the ship. Kroll sucked in his breath, hesitated, then smiled
a grey smile.</p>

<p>"You heard him, Douglas. Get him a bulger."</p>

<p>"And get a stretcher! And tote this ninety pounds of bone out on the
biggest asteroid around here! Got that?"</p>

<p>"You heard him, Haines! A stretcher! Stand by for maneuvering!" Kroll
sat down by the old man. "What's it all about, Pop? You're&mdash;sober?"</p>

<p>"Clear as a bell!"</p>

<p>"What're you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Redeem myself of my sins, by George! Now get your ugly face away so I
can think! And tell them bucks to hurry!"</p>

<p>Kroll bellowed and men rushed. They brought a space-suit, inserted the
ninety pounds of shrill and wheeze and weakness into it&mdash;the doctor had
finished with his probings and fixings&mdash;buckled, zipped and welded him
into it. All the while they worked, Nibley talked.</p>

<p>"Remember when I was a kid. Stood up to that there plate poundin' out
baseballs North, South and six ways from Sundays." He chuckled. "Used
to hit 'em, and predict which window in what house they'd break!"
Wheezy laughter. "One day I said to my Dad, 'Hey, Dad, a meteor just
fell on Simpson's Garage over in Jonesville.' 'Jonesville is six miles
from here', said my father, shakin' his finger at me. 'You quit your
lyin', Nibley boy, or I'll trot you to the woodshed!'"</p>

<p>"Save your strength," said Kroll.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Nibley. "You know the funny thing was always
that I lied like hell and everybody said I lied like hell, but come
to find out, later, I wasn't lyin' at all, it was the truth. I just
<i>sensed</i> things."</p>

<p>The ship maneuvered down on a windless, empty planetoid. Nibley was
carried on a stretcher out onto alien rock.</p>

<p>"Lay me down right here. Prop up my head so I can see Jupiter and the
whole damned Asteroid Belt. Be sure my headphones are tuned neat.
There. Now, give me a piece of paper."</p>

<p>Nibley scribbled a long weak snake of writing on paper, folded it.
"When Bruno comes to, give him this. Maybe he'll believe me when he
reads it. Personal. Don't pry into it yourself."</p>

<p>The old man sank back, feeling pain drilling through his stomach, and a
kind of sad happiness. Somebody was singing somewhere, he didn't know
where. Maybe it was only the stars moving on the sky.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, clearly. "Guess this is it, children. Now get the
hell aboard, leave me alone to think. This is going to be the biggest,
hardest, damnedest job of computatin' I ever latched onto! There'll be
orbits and cross orbits, big balls of fire and little bitty specules,
and, by God, I'll chart 'em all! I'll chart a hundred thousand of the
damned monsters and their offspring, you just wait and see! Get aboard!
I'll tell you what to do from there on."</p>

<p>Douglas looked doubtful.</p>

<p>Nibley caught the look. "What ever happens," he cried. "Will be worth
it, won't it? It's better than turnin' back to Mars, ain't it? Well,
<i>ain't</i> it?"</p>

<p>"It's better," said Douglas. They shook hands.</p>

<p>"Now all of you, get!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nibley watched the ship fire away and his eyes saw it and the Asteroid
Swarm and that brilliant point of light that was massive Jupiter. He
could almost feel the hunger and want and waiting up there in that star
flame.</p>

<p>He looked out into space and his eyes widened and space came in, opened
out like a flower, and already, natural as water flowing, Nibley's
mind, tired as it was, began to shiver out calculations. He started
talking.</p>

<p>"Captain? Take the ship straight out now. You hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Fine</i>," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Look at your dials."</p>

<p>"<i>Looking.</i>"</p>

<p>"If number seven reads 132:87, okay. Keep 'er there. If she varies a
point, counteract it on Dial Twenty to 56.90. Keep her hard over for
seventy thousand miles, all that is clear so far. Then, after that, a
sharp veer in number two direction, over a thousand miles. There's a
big sweep of meteors coming in on that other path for you to dodge. Let
me see, let me see&mdash;" He figured. "Keep your speed at a constant of one
hundred thousand miles. At that rate&mdash;check your clocks and watches&mdash;in
exactly an hour you'll hit the second part of the Big Belt. Then switch
to a course roughly five thousand miles over to number 3 direction,
veer again five minutes on the dot later and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Can you see all those asteroids, Nibley. Are you sure?</i>"</p>

<p>"Sure. Lots of 'em. Every single one going every which way! Keep
straight ahead until two hours from now, after that last direction of
mine&mdash;then slide off at an angle toward Jupiter, slow down to ninety
thousand for ten minutes, then up to a hundred ten thousand for fifteen
minutes. After that, one hundred fifty thousand all the way!"</p>

<p>Flame poured out of the rocket jets. It moved swiftly away, growing
small and distant.</p>

<p>"Give me a read on dial 67!"</p>

<p>"<i>Four.</i>"</p>

<p>"Make it six! And set your automatic pilot to 61 and 14 and 35.
Now&mdash;everything's okay. Keep your chronometer reading this way&mdash;seven,
nine, twelve. There'll be a few tight scrapes, but you'll hit Jupiter
square on in 24 hours, if you jump your speed to 700,000 six hours from
now and hold it that way."</p>

<p>"<i>Square on it is, Mr. Nibley.</i>"</p>

<p>Nibley just lay there a moment. His voice was easy and not so high and
shrill any more. "And on the way back to Mars, later, don't try to find
me. I'm going out in the dark on this metal rock. Nothing but dark for
me. Back to perihelion and sun for you. Know&mdash;know where <i>I'm</i> going?"</p>

<p>"<i>Where?</i>"</p>

<p>"Centaurus!" Nibley laughed. "So help me God I am. No lie!"</p>

<p>He watched the ship going out, then, and he felt the compact, collected
trajectories of all the men in it. It was a good feeling to know that
he was the guiding theme. Like in the old days....</p>

<p>Douglas' voice broke in again.</p>

<p>"<i>Hey, Pop. Pop, you still there?</i>"</p>

<p>A little silence. Nibley felt blood pulsing down inside his suit.
"Yep," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>We just gave Bruno your little note to read. Whatever it was, when he
finished reading it, he went insane.</i>"</p>

<p>Nibley said, quiet-like. "Burn that there paper. Don't let anybody else
read it."</p>

<p>A pause. "<i>It's burnt. What was it?</i>"</p>

<p>"Don't be inquisitive," snapped the old man. "Maybe I proved to Bruno
that he didn't really exist. To hell with it!"</p>

<p>The rocket reached its constant speed. Douglas radioed back: "<i>All's
well. Sweet calculating, Pop. I'll tell the Rocket Officials back at
Marsport. They'll be glad to know about you. Sweet, sweet calculating.
Thanks. How goes it? I said&mdash;how goes it? Hey, Pop! Pop?</i>"</p>

<p>Nibley raised a trembling hand and waved it at nothing. The ship was
gone. He couldn't even see the jet-wash now, he could only feel that
hard metal movement out there among the stars, going on and on through
a course he had set for it. He couldn't speak. There was just emotion
in him. He had finally, by God, heard a compliment from a mechanic of
radar-computators!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>He waved his hand at nothing. He watched nothing moving on and on into
the crossed orbits of other invisible nothings. The silence was now
complete.</p>

<p>He put his hand down. Now he had only to chart that one last personal
orbit. The one he had wanted to finish only in space and not grounded
back on Mars.</p>

<p>It didn't take lightning calculation to set it out for certain.</p>

<p>Life and death were the parabolic ends to his trajectory. The long
life, first swinging in from darkness, arcing to the inevitable
perihelion, and now moving back out, out and away&mdash;</p>

<p>Into the soft, encompassing dark.</p>

<p>"By God," he thought weakly, quietly. "Right up to the last, my
reputation's good. Never fluked a calculation yet, and I never will...."</p>

<p>He didn't.</p>

<h1>Pillar of Fire</h1>
<p>He came out of the earth, hating. Hate was his father; hate was his
mother.</p>

<p>It was good to walk again. It was good to leap up out of the earth, off
of your back, and stretch your cramped arms violently and try to take a
deep breath!</p>

<p>He <i>tried</i>. He cried out.</p>

<p>He couldn't breathe. He flung his arms over his face and tried to
breathe. It was impossible. He walked on the earth, he came out of the
earth. But he was dead. He couldn't breathe. He could take air into
his mouth and force it half down his throat, with withered moves of
long-dormant muscles, wildly, wildly! And with this little air he
could shout and cry! He wanted to have tears, but he couldn't make them
come, either. All he knew was that he was standing upright, he was
dead, he shouldn't be walking! He couldn't breathe and yet he stood.</p>

<p>The smells of the world were all about him. Frustratedly, he tried to
smell the smells of autumn. Autumn was burning the land down into ruin.
All across the country the ruins of summer lay; vast forests bloomed
with flame, tumbled down timber on empty, unleafed timber. The smoke of
the burning was rich, blue, and invisible.</p>

<p>He stood in the graveyard, hating. He walked through the world and yet
could not taste nor smell of it. He heard, yes. The wind roared on
his newly opened ears. But he was dead. Even though he walked he knew
he was dead and should expect not too much of himself or this hateful
living world.</p>

<p>He touched the tombstone over his own empty grave. He knew his own name
again. It was a good job of carving.</p>

<p>WILLIAM LANTRY</p>

<p>That's what the grave stone said.</p>

<p>His fingers trembled on the cool stone surface.</p>

<p>BORN 1898&mdash;DIED 1933</p>

<p>Born <i>again</i>...?</p>

<p>What year? He glared at the sky and the midnight autumnal stars moving
in slow illuminations across the windy black. He read the tiltings of
centuries in those stars. Orion thus and so, Aurega here! and where
Taurus? <i>There!</i></p>

<p>His eyes narrowed. His lips spelled out the year:</p>

<p>"2349."</p>

<p>An odd number. Like a school sum. They used to say a man couldn't
encompass any number over a hundred. After that it was all so damned
abstract there was no use counting. This was the year 2349! A numeral,
a sum. And here he was, a man who had lain in his hateful dark coffin,
hating to be buried, hating the living people above who lived and lived
and lived, hating them for all the centuries, until today, now, born
out of hatred, he stood by his own freshly excavated grave, the smell
of raw earth in the air, perhaps, but he could not smell it!</p>

<p>"I," he said, addressing a poplar tree that was shaken by the wind, "am
an anachronism." He smiled faintly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He looked at the graveyard. It was cold and empty. All of the stones
had been ripped up and piled like so many flat bricks, one atop
another, in the far corner by the wrought iron fence. This had been
going on for two endless weeks. In his deep secret coffin he had heard
the heartless, wild stirring as the men jabbed the earth with cold
spades and tore out the coffins and carried away the withered ancient
bodies to be burned. Twisting with fear in his coffin, he had waited
for them to come to him.</p>

<p>Today they had arrived at his coffin. But&mdash;late. They had dug down to
within an inch of the lid. Five o'clock bell, time for quitting. Home
to supper. The workers had gone off. Tomorrow they would finish the
job, they said, shrugging into their coats.</p>

<p>Silence had come to the emptied tombyard.</p>

<p>Carefully, quietly, with a soft rattling of sod, the coffin lid had
lifted.</p>

<p>William Lantry stood trembling now, in the last cemetery on Earth.</p>

<p>"Remember?" he asked himself, looking at the raw earth. "Remember those
stories of the last man on earth? Those stories of men wandering in
ruins, alone? Well, you, William Lantry, are a switch on the old story.
Do you <i>know</i> that? You are the last <i>dead</i> man in the whole damned
world!"</p>

<p>There were no more dead people. Nowhere in any land was there a dead
person. Impossible? Lantry did not smile at this. No, not impossible
at all in this foolish sterile, unimaginative, antiseptic age of
cleansings and scientific methods! People died, oh my god, yes.
But&mdash;<i>dead</i> people? Corpses? They didn't exist!</p>

<p>What <i>happened</i> to dead people?</p>

<p>The graveyard was on a hill. William Lantry walked through the dark
burning night until he reached the edge of the graveyard and looked
down upon the new town of Salem. It was all illumination, all color.
Rocket ships cut fire above it, crossing the sky to all the far ports
of earth.</p>

<p>In his grave the new violence of this future world had driven down and
seeped into William Lantry. He had been bathed in it for years. He knew
all about it, with a hating dead man's knowledge of such things.</p>

<p>Most important of all, he knew what these fools did with dead men.</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes. In the center of the town a massive stone finger
pointed at the stars. It was three hundred feet high and fifty feet
across. There was a wide entrance and a drive in front of it.</p>

<p>In the town, theoretically, thought William Lantry, say you have a
dying man. In a moment he will be dead. What happens? No sooner is his
pulse cold when a certificate is flourished, made out, his relatives
pack him into a car-beetle and drive him swiftly to&mdash;</p>

<p>The Incinerator!</p>

<p>That functional finger, that Pillar of Fire pointing at the stars.
Incinerator. A functional, terrible name. But truth is truth in this
future world.</p>

<p>Like a stick of kindling your Mr. Dead Man is shot into the furnace.</p>

<p><i>Flume!</i></p>

<p>William Lantry looked at the top of the gigantic pistol shoving at the
stars. A small pennant of smoke issued from the top.</p>

<p>There's where your dead people go.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself, William Lantry," he murmured. "You're the last
one, the rare item, the last dead man. All the other graveyards of
earth have been blasted up. This is the last graveyard and you're the
last dead man from the centuries. These people don't believe in having
dead people about, much less walking dead people. Everything that can't
be used goes up like a matchstick. Superstitions right along with it!"</p>

<p>He looked at the town. All right, he thought, quietly. I hate you. You
hate me, or you <i>would</i> if you knew I existed. You don't believe in
such things as vampires or ghosts. Labels without referents, you cry!
You snort. All right, snort! Frankly, I don't believe in <i>you</i>, either!
I don't <i>like</i> you! You and your Incinerators.</p>

<p>He trembled. How very close it had been. Day after day they had hauled
out the other dead ones, burned them like so much kindling. An edict
had been broadcast around the world. He had heard the digging men talk
as they worked!</p>

<p>"I guess it's a good idea, this cleaning up the graveyards," said one
of the men.</p>

<p>"Guess so," said another. "Grisly custom. Can you imagine? Being
buried, I mean! Unhealthy! All them germs!"</p>

<p>"Sort of a shame. Romantic, kind of. I mean, leaving just this one
graveyard untouched all these centuries. The other graveyards were
cleaned out, what year was it, Jim?"</p>

<p>"About 2260, I think. Yeah, that was it, 2260, almost a hundred years
ago. But some Salem Committee they got on their high horse and they
said, 'Look here, let's have just ONE graveyard left, to remind us of
the customs of the barbarians.' And the gover'ment scratched its head,
thunk it over, and said, 'Okay. Salem it is. But all other graveyards
go, you understand, all!'"</p>

<p>"And away they went," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Sure, they sucked out 'em with fire and steam shovels and
rocket-cleaners. If they knew a man was buried in a cow-pasture, they
fixed him! Evacuated them, they did. Sort of cruel, I say."</p>

<p>"I hate to sound old-fashioned, but still there were a lot of tourists
came here every year, just to see what a real graveyard was like."</p>

<p>"Right. We had nearly a million people in the last three years
visiting. A good revenue. But&mdash;a government order is an order. The
government says no more morbidity, so flush her out we do! Here we go.
Hand me that spade, Bill."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>William Lantry stood in the autumn wind, on the hill. It was good to
walk again, to feel the wind and to hear the leaves scuttling like mice
on the road ahead of him. It was good to see the bitter cold stars
almost blown away by the wind.</p>

<p>It was even good to know fear again.</p>

<p>For fear rose in him now, and he could not put it away. The very fact
that he was walking made him an enemy. And there was not another
friend, another dead man, in all of the world, to whom one could turn
for help or consolation. It was the whole melodramatic living world
against one William Lantry. It was the whole vampire-disbelieving,
body-burning, graveyard-annihilating world against a man in a dark
suit on a dark autumn hill. He put out his pale cold hands into the
city illumination. You have pulled the tombstones, like teeth, from
the yard, he thought. Now I will find some way to push your damnable
Incinerators down into rubble. I will make dead people again, and I
will make friends in so doing. I cannot be alone and lonely. I must
start manufacturing friends very soon. Tonight.</p>

<p>"War is declared," he said, and laughed. It was pretty silly, one man
declaring war on an entire world.</p>

<p>The world did not answer back. A rocket crossed the sky on a rush of
flame, like an Incinerator taking wing.</p>

<p>Footsteps. Lantry hastened to the edge of the cemetery. The diggers,
coming back to finish up their work? No. Just someone, a man, walking
by.</p>

<p>As the man came abreast the cemetery gate, Lantry stepped swiftly out.
"Good evening," said the man, smiling.</p>

<p>Lantry struck the man in the face. The man fell. Lantry bent quietly
down and hit the man a killing blow across the neck with the side of
his hand.</p>

<p>Dragging the body back into shadow, he stripped it, changed clothes
with it. It wouldn't do for a fellow to go wandering about this future
world with ancient clothing on. He found a small pocket knife in the
man's coat; not much of a knife, but enough if you knew how to handle
it properly. He knew how.</p>

<p>He rolled the body down into one of the already opened and exhumed
graves. In a minute he had shoveled dirt down upon it, just enough to
hide it. There was little chance of it being found. They wouldn't dig
the same grave twice.</p>

<p>He adjusted himself in his new loose-fitting metallic suit. Fine, fine.</p>

<p>Hating, William Lantry walked down into town, to do battle with the
Earth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">II</p>

<p>The incinerator was open. It never closed. There was a wide entrance,
all lighted up with hidden illumination, there was a helicopter landing
table and a beetle drive. The town itself was dying down after another
day of the dynamo. The lights were going dim, and the only quiet,
lighted spot in the town now was the Incinerator. God, what a practical
name, what an unromantic name.</p>

<p>William Lantry entered the wide, well-lighted door. It was an entrance,
really; there were no doors to open or shut. People could go in and
out, summer or winter, the inside was always warm. Warm from the fire
that rushed whispering up the high round flue to where the whirlers,
the propellors, the air-jets pushed the leafy grey ashes on away for a
ten mile ride down the sky.</p>

<p>There was the warmth of the bakery here. The halls were floored with
rubber parquet. You couldn't make a noise if you wanted to. Music
played in hidden throats somewhere. Not music of death at all, but
music of life and the way the sun lived inside the Incinerator; or the
sun's brother, anyway. You could hear the flame floating inside the
heavy brick wall.</p>

<p>William Lantry descended a ramp. Behind him he heard a whisper and
turned in time to see a beetle stop before the entrance way. A bell
rang. The music, as if at a signal, rose to ecstatic heights. There was
joy in it.</p>

<p>From the beetle, which opened from the rear, some attendants stepped
carrying a golden box. It was six feet long and there were sun symbols
on it. From another beetle the relatives of the man in the box stepped
and followed as the attendants took the golden box down a ramp to a
kind of altar. On the side of the altar were the words, "WE THAT WERE
BORN OF THE SUN RETURN TO THE SUN". The golden box was deposited upon
the altar, the music leaped upward, the Guardian of this place spoke
only a few words, then the attendants picked up the golden box, walked
to a transparent wall, a safety lock, also transparent, and opened it.
The box was shoved into the glass slot. A moment later an inner lock
opened, the box was injected into the interior of the Flue and vanished
instantly in quick flame.</p>

<p>The attendants walked away. The relatives without a word turned and
walked out. The music played.</p>

<p>William Lantry approached the glass fire lock. He peered through the
wall at the vast, glowing, never-ceasing heart of the Incinerator. It
burned steadily, without a flicker, singing to itself peacefully. It
was so solid it was like a golden river flowing up out of the earth
toward the sky. Anything you put into the river was borne upward,
vanished.</p>

<p>Lantry felt again his unreasoning hatred of this thing, this monster,
cleansing fire.</p>

<p>A man stood at his elbow. "May I help you, sir?"</p>

<p>"What?" Lantry turned abruptly. "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"May I be of service?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;that is&mdash;" Lantry looked quickly at the ramp and the door. His
hands trembled at his sides. "I've never been in here before."</p>

<p>"Never?" The Attendant was surprised.</p>

<p>That had been the wrong thing to say, Lantry realized. But it was said,
nevertheless. "I mean," he said. "Not really. I mean, when you're a
child, somehow, you don't pay attention. I suddenly realized tonight
that I didn't really <i>know</i> the Incinerator."</p>

<p>The Attendant smiled. "We never know anything, do we, really? I'll be
glad to show you around."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Never mind. It&mdash;it's a wonderful place."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is." The Attendant took pride in it. "One of the finest in the
world, I think."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" Lantry felt he must explain further. "I haven't had many
relatives die on me since I was a child. In fact, none. So, you see I
haven't been here for many years."</p>

<p>"I see." The Attendant's face seemed to darken somewhat.</p>

<p>What've I said now, thought Lantry. What in God's name is wrong?
What've I done? If I'm not careful I'll get myself shoved right into
that damnable fire-trap. What's wrong with this fellow's face? He seems
to be giving me more than the usual going over.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be one of the men who've just returned from Mars, would
you?" asked the Attendant.</p>

<p>"No. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"No matter." The Attendant began to walk off. "If you want to know
anything, just ask me."</p>

<p>"Just one thing," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"This."</p>

<p>Lantry dealt him a stunning blow across the neck.</p>

<p>He had watched the fire-trap operator with expert eyes. Now, with the
sagging body in his arms, he touched the button that opened the warm
outer lock, placed the body in, heard the music rise, and saw the inner
lock open. The body shot out into the river of fire. The music softened.</p>

<p>"Well done, Lantry, well done."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Barely an instant later another Attendant entered the room. Lantry
was caught with an expression of pleased excitement on his face. The
Attendant looked around as if expecting to find someone, then he walked
toward Lantry. "May I help you?"</p>

<p>"Just looking," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Rather late at night," said the Attendant.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep."</p>

<p>That was the wrong answer, too. Everybody slept in this world. Nobody
had insomnia. If you did you simply turned on a hypno-ray, and, sixty
seconds later, you were snoring. Oh, he was just <i>full</i> of wrong
answers. First he had made the fatal error of saying he had never been
in the Incinerator before, when he knew damned well that all children
were brought here on tours, every year, from the time they were four,
to instill the idea of the clean fire death and the Incinerator in
their minds. Death was a bright fire, death was warmth and the sun. It
was not a dark, shadowed thing. That was important in their education.
And he, pale thoughtless fool, had immediately gabbled out his
ignorance.</p>

<p>And another thing, this paleness of his. He looked at his hands and
realized with growing terror that a pale man also was non-existent in
this world. They would suspect his paleness. That was why the first
attendant had asked, "Are you one of those men newly returned from
Mars?" Here, now, this new Attendant was clean and bright as a copper
penny, his cheeks red with health and energy. Lantry hid his pale hands
in his pockets. But he was fully aware of the searching the Attendant
did on his face.</p>

<p>"I mean to say," said Lantry. "I didn't <i>want</i> to sleep. I wanted to
think."</p>

<p>"Was there a service held here a moment ago?" asked the Attendant,
looking about.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I just came in."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard the fire lock open and shut."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Lantry.</p>

<p>The man pressed a wall button. "Anderson?"</p>

<p>A voice replied. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Locate Saul for me, will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll ring the corridors." A pause. "Can't find him."</p>

<p>"Thanks." The Attendant was puzzled. He was beginning to make little
sniffing motions with his nose. "Do you&mdash;<i>smell</i> anything?"</p>

<p>Lantry sniffed. "No. Why?"</p>

<p>"I <i>smell</i> something."</p>

<p>Lantry took hold of the knife in his pocket. He waited.</p>

<p>"I remember once when I was a kid," said the man. "And we found a cow
lying dead in the field. It had been there two days in the hot sun.
That's what this smell is. I wonder what it's from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what it is," said Lantry quietly. He held out his hand.
"Here."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Me, of course."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Dead several hundred years."</p>

<p>"You're an odd joker." The Attendant was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Very." Lantry took out the knife. "Do you know what this is?"</p>

<p>"A knife."</p>

<p>"Do you ever use knives on people any more?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;killing them, with knives or guns or poison?"</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> an odd joker!" The man giggled awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to kill you," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Nobody kills anybody," said the man.</p>

<p>"Not any more they don't. But they used to, in the old days."</p>

<p>"I know they did."</p>

<p>"This will be the first murder in three hundred years. I just killed
your friend. I just shoved him into the fire lock."</p>

<p>That remark had the desired effect. It numbed the man so completely, it
shocked him so thoroughly with its illogical aspects that Lantry had
time to walk forward. He put the knife against the man's chest. "I'm
going to kill you."</p>

<p>"That's silly," said the man, numbly. "People don't do that."</p>

<p>"Like this," said Lantry. "You see?"</p>

<p>The knife slid into the chest. The man stared at it for a moment.
Lantry caught the falling body.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">III</p>

<p>The Salem flue exploded at six that morning. The great fire chimney
shattered into ten thousand parts and flung itself into the earth and
into the sky and into the houses of the sleeping people. There was fire
and sound, more fire than autumn made burning in the hills.</p>

<p>William Lantry was five miles away at the time of the explosion. He
saw the town ignited by the great spreading cremation of it. And he
shook his head and laughed a little bit and clapped his hands smartly
together.</p>

<p>Relatively simple. You walked around killing people who didn't believe
in murder, had only heard of it indirectly as some dim gone custom
of the old barbarian races. You walked into the control room of the
Incinerator and said, "How do you work this Incinerator?" and the
control man told you, because everybody told the truth in this world
of the future, nobody lied, there was no reason to lie, there was no
danger to lie <i>against</i>. There was only one criminal in the world, and
nobody knew HE existed yet.</p>

<p>Oh, it was an incredibly beautiful set-up. The Control Man had told
him just how the Incinerator worked, what pressure gauges controlled
the flood of fire gasses going up the flue, what levers were adjusted
or readjusted. He and Lantry had had quite a talk. It was an easy free
world. People trusted people. A moment later Lantry had shoved a knife
in the Control Man also and set the pressure gauges for an overload
to occur half an hour later, and walked out of the Incinerator halls,
whistling.</p>

<p>Now even the sky was palled with the vast black cloud of the explosion.</p>

<p>"This is only the first," said Lantry, looking at the sky. "I'll tear
all the others down before they even suspect there's an unethical man
loose in their society. They can't account for a variable like me.
I'm beyond their understanding. I'm incomprehensible, impossible,
therefore I do not exist. My God, I can kill hundreds of thousands of
them before they even realize murder is out in the world again. I can
make it look like an accident each time. Why, the idea is so huge, it's
unbelievable!"</p>

<p>The fire burned the town. He sat under a tree for a long time, until
morning. Then, he found a cave in the hills, and went in, to sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He awoke at sunset with a sudden dream of fire. He saw himself pushed
into the flue, cut into sections by flame, burned away to nothing. He
sat up on the cave floor, laughing at himself. He had an idea.</p>

<p>He walked down into the town and stepped into an audio booth. He dialed
OPERATOR. "Give me the Police Department," he said.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said the operator.</p>

<p>He tried again. "The Law Force," he said.</p>

<p>"I will connect you with the Peace Control," she said, at last.</p>

<p>A little fear began ticking inside him like a tiny watch. Suppose the
operator recognized the term Police Department as an anachronism, took
his audio number, and sent someone out to investigate? No, she wouldn't
do that. Why should she suspect? Paranoids were non-existent in this
civilization.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Peace Control," he said.</p>

<p>A buzz. A man's voice answered. "Peace Control. Stephens speaking."</p>

<p>"Give me the Homicide Detail," said Lantry, smiling.</p>

<p>"The <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Who investigates murders?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Wrong number." Lantry hung up, chuckling. Ye gods, there was no such
a thing as a Homicide Detail. There were no murders, therefore they
needed no detectives. Perfect, perfect!</p>

<p>The audio rang back. Lantry hesitated, then answered.</p>

<p>"Say," said the voice on the phone. "Who <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"The man just left who called," said Lantry, and hung up again.</p>

<p>He ran. They would recognize his voice and perhaps send someone out
to check. People didn't lie. <i>He</i> had just lied. They knew his voice.
He had lied. Anybody who lied needed a psychiatrist. They would come
to pick him up to see why he was lying. For no <i>other</i> reason. They
suspected him of nothing else. Therefore&mdash;he must run.</p>

<p>Oh, how very carefully he must act from now on. He knew nothing of this
world, this odd straight truthful ethical world. Simply by looking
pale you were suspect. Simply by not sleeping nights you were suspect.
Simply by not bathing, by smelling like a&mdash;dead cow?&mdash;you were suspect.
Anything.</p>

<p>He must go to a library. But that was dangerous, too. What were
libraries like today? Did they have books or did they have film spools
which projected books on a screen? Or did people have libraries at
home, thus eliminating the necessity of keeping large main libraries?</p>

<p>He decided to chance it. His use of archaic terms might well make him
suspect again, but now it was very important he learn all that could be
learned of this foul world into which he had come again. He stopped a
man on the street. "Which way to the library?"</p>

<p>The man was not surprised. "Two blocks east, one block north."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Simple as that.</p>

<p>He walked into the library a few minutes later.</p>

<p>"May I help you?"</p>

<p>He looked at the librarian. May I help you, may I help you. What a
world of helpful people! "I'd like to 'have' Edgar Allan Poe." His
verb was carefully chosen. He didn't say 'read'. He was too afraid
that books were passé, that printing itself was a lost art. Maybe all
'books' today were in the form of fully delineated three-dimensional
motion pictures. How in hell could you make a motion picture out of
Socrates, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Freud?</p>

<p>"What was that name again?"</p>

<p>"Edgar Allan Poe."</p>

<p>"There is no such author listed in our files."</p>

<p>"Will you please check?"</p>

<p>She checked. "Oh, yes. There's a red mark on the file card. He was one
of the authors in the Great Burning of 2265."</p>

<p>"How ignorant of me."</p>

<p>"That's all right," she said. "Have you heard much of him?"</p>

<p>"He had some interesting barbarian ideas on death," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Horrible ones," she said, wrinkling her nose. "Ghastly."</p>

<p>"Yes. Ghastly. Abominable, in fact. Good thing he was burned. Unclean.
By the way, do you have any of Lovecraft?"</p>

<p>"Is that a sex book?"</p>

<p>Lantry exploded with laughter. "No, no. It's a man."</p>

<p>She riffled the file. "He was burned, too. Along with Poe."</p>

<p>"I suppose that applies to Machen and a man named Derleth and one named
Ambrose Bierce, also?"</p>

<p>"Yes." She shut the file cabinet. "All burned. And good riddance." She
gave him an odd warm look of interest. "I bet you've just come back
from Mars."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"There was another explorer in here yesterday. He'd just made the Mars
hop and return. He was interested in supernatural literature, also. It
seems there are actually 'tombs' on Mars."</p>

<p>"What are 'tombs'?" Lantry was learning to keep his mouth closed.</p>

<p>"You know, those things they once buried people in."</p>

<p>"Barbarian custom. Ghastly!"</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> it? Well, seeing the Martian tombs made this young explorer
curious. He came and asked if we had any of those authors you
mentioned. Of course we haven't even a smitch of their stuff." She
looked at his pale face. "You <i>are</i> one of the Martian rocket men,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Got back on the ship the other day."</p>

<p>"The other young man's name was Burke."</p>

<p>"Of course. Burke! Good friend of mine!"</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't help you. You'd best get yourself some vitamin shots and
some sun-lamp. You look terrible, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Lantry. I'll be good. Thanks ever so much. See you next Hallows' Eve!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you the clever one." She laughed. "If there <i>were</i> a Hallows'
Eve, I'd make it a date."</p>

<p>"But they burned <i>that</i>, too," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, they burned everything," she said. "Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night." And he went on out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Oh, how carefully he was balanced in this world! Like some kind of
dark gyroscope, whirling with never a murmur, a very silent man. As
he walked along the eight o'clock evening street he noticed with
particular interest that there was not an unusual amount of lights
about. There were the usual street lights at each corner, but the
blocks themselves were only faintly illuminated. Could it be that these
remarkable people were not <i>afraid of the dark</i>? Incredible nonsense!
<i>Every one</i> was afraid of the dark. <i>Even he</i> himself had been afraid,
as a child. It was as natural as eating.</p>

<p>A little boy ran by on pelting feet, followed by six others. They
yelled and shouted and rolled on the dark cool October lawn, in the
leaves. Lantry looked on for several minutes before addressing himself
to one of the small boys who was for a moment taking a respite,
gathering his breath into his small lungs, as a boy might blow to
refill a punctured paper bag.</p>

<p>"Here, now," said Lantry. "You'll wear yourself out."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me," said the man, "why there are no street lights in
the middle of the blocks?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I'm a teacher, I thought I'd test your knowledge," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Well," said the boy, "you don't need lights in the middle of the
block, that's why."</p>

<p>"But it gets rather dark," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"So?" said the boy.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid?" asked Lantry.</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"The dark," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Ho ho," said the boy. "Why should I be?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lantry. "It's black, it's dark. And after all, street
lights were invented to take away the dark and take away fear."</p>

<p>"That's silly. Street lights were made so you could see where you were
walking. Outside of that there's nothing."</p>

<p>"You miss the whole point&mdash;" said Lantry. "Do you mean to say you would
sit in the middle of an empty lot all night and not be afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of what, of what, of what, you little ninny! Of the dark!"</p>

<p>"Ho ho."</p>

<p>"Would you go out in the hills and stay all night in the dark?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Would you stay in a deserted house alone?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"And not be afraid?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"You're a liar!"</p>

<p>"Don't you call me nasty names!" shouted the boy. Liar was the improper
noun, indeed. It seemed to be the worst thing you could call a person.</p>

<p>Lantry was completely furious with the little monster. "Look," he
insisted. "Look into my eyes...."</p>

<p>The boy looked.</p>

<p>Lantry bared his teeth slightly. He put out his hands, making a
clawlike gesture. He leered and gesticulated and wrinkled his face into
a terrible mask of horror.</p>

<p>"Ho ho," said the boy. "You're funny."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> did you say?"</p>

<p>"You're funny. Do it again. Hey, gang, c'mere! This man does funny
things!"</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>"Do it again, sir."</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind. Good night!" Lantry ran off.</p>

<p>"Good night, sir. And mind the dark, sir!" called the little boy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all the stupidity, of all the rank, gross, crawling, jelly-mouthed
stupidity! He had never seen the like of it in his life! Bringing the
children up without so much as an <i>ounce</i> of imagination! Where was the
fun in being children if you didn't imagine things?</p>

<p>He stopped running. He slowed and for the first time began to
appraise himself. He ran his hand over his face and bit his finger
and found that he himself was standing midway in the block and he
felt uncomfortable. He moved up to the street corner where there was a
glowing lantern. "That's better," he said, holding his hands out like a
man to an open warm fire.</p>

<p>He listened. There was not a sound except the night breathing of the
crickets. Faintly there was a fire-hush as a rocket swept the sky. It
was the sound a torch might make brandished gently on the dark air.</p>

<p>He listened to himself and for the first time he realized what there
was so peculiar to himself. There was not a sound in him. The little
nostril and lung noises were absent. His lungs did not take nor give
oxygen or carbon-dioxide; they did not move. The hairs in his nostrils
did not quiver with warm combing air. That faint purring whisper of
breathing did not sound in his nose. Strange. Funny. A noise you never
heard when you were alive, the breath that fed your body, and yet, once
dead, oh how you missed it!</p>

<p>The only other time you ever heard it was on deep dreamless awake
nights when you wakened and listened and heard first your nose taking
and gently poking out the air, and then the dull deep dim red thunder
of the blood in your temples, in your eardrums, in your throat, in
your aching wrists, in your warm loins, in your chest. All of those
little rhythms, gone. The wrist beat gone, the throat pulse gone, the
chest vibration gone. The sound of the blood coming up down around and
through, up down around and through. Now it was like listening to a
statue.</p>

<p>And yet he <i>lived</i>. Or, rather, moved about. And how was this done,
over and above scientific explanations, theories, doubts?</p>

<p>By one thing, and one thing alone.</p>

<p>Hatred.</p>

<p>Hatred was a blood in him, it went up down around and through, up down
around and through. It was a heart in him, not beating, true, but warm.
He was&mdash;what? Resentment. Envy. They said he could not lie any longer
in his coffin in the cemetery. He had <i>wanted</i> to. He had never had any
particular desire to get up and walk around. It had been enough, all
these centuries, to lie in the deep box and feel but <i>not feel</i> the
ticking of the million insect watches in the earth around, the moves of
worms like so many deep thoughts in the soil.</p>

<p>But then they had come and said, "Out you go and into the furnace!" And
that is the worst thing you can say to any man. You cannot tell him
what to do. If you say you are dead, he will want not to be dead. If
you say there are no such things as vampires, by God, that man will try
to <i>be</i> one just for spite. If you say a dead man cannot walk, he will
test his limbs. If you say murder is no longer occurring, he will make
it occur. He was, <i>in toto</i>, all the impossible things. They had given
birth to him with their damnable practices and ignorances. Oh, how
wrong they were. They needed to be shown. He would <i>show</i> them! Sun is
<i>good</i>, so is <i>night</i>, there is nothing wrong with dark, <i>they</i> said.</p>

<p>Dark is horror, he shouted, silently, facing the little houses. It is
<i>meant</i> for contrast. You must fear, you hear! That has always been
the way of this world. You destroyers of Edgar Allan Poe and fine
big-worded Lovecraft, you burner of Hallowe'en masks and destroyer of
pumpkin jack-o-lanterns! I will make night what it <i>once</i> was, the
thing against which man built all his lanterned cities and his many
children!</p>

<p>As if in answer to this, a rocket, flying low, trailing a long rakish
feather of flame. It made Lantry flinch and draw back.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">IV</p>

<p>It was but ten miles to the little town of Science Port. He made it by
dawn, walking. But even this was not good. At four in the morning a
silver beetle pulled up on the road beside him.</p>

<p>"Hello," called the man inside.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Lantry, wearily.</p>

<p>"Why are you walking?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Science Port."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ride?"</p>

<p>"I <i>like</i> to walk."</p>

<p>"<i>Nobody</i> likes to walk. Are you sick? May I give you a ride?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I like to walk."</p>

<p>The man hesitated, then closed the beetle door. "Good night."</p>

<p>When the beetle was gone over the hill, Lantry retreated into a nearby
forest. A world full of bungling helping people. By God, you couldn't
even <i>walk</i> without being accused of sickness. That meant only one
thing. He must not walk any longer, he had to ride. He should have
accepted that fellow's offer.</p>

<p>The rest of the night he walked far enough off the highway so that if
a beetle rushed by he had time to vanish in the underbrush. At dawn he
crept into an empty dry water-drain and closed his eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The dream was as perfect as a rimed snowflake.</i></p>

<p><i>He saw the graveyard where he had lain deep and ripe over the
centuries. He heard the early morning footsteps of the laborers
returning to finish their work.</i></p>

<p><i>"Would you mind passing me the shovel, Jim?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Here you go."</i></p>

<p><i>"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"</i></p>

<p><i>"What's up?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Look here. We didn't finish last night, did we?"</i></p>

<p><i>"No."</i></p>

<p><i>"There was one more coffin, wasn't there?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Yes."</i></p>

<p><i>"Well, here it is, and open!"</i></p>

<p><i>"You've got the wrong hole."</i></p>

<p><i>"What's the name say on the gravestone?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Lantry. William Lantry."</i></p>

<p><i>"That's him, that's the one! Gone!"</i></p>

<p><i>"What could have happened to it?"</i></p>

<p><i>"How do I know. The body was here last night."</i></p>

<p><i>"We can't be sure, we didn't look."</i></p>

<p><i>"God, man, people don't bury empty coffins. He was in his box. Now he
isn't."</i></p>

<p><i>"Maybe this box was empty."</i></p>

<p><i>"Nonsense. Smell that smell? He was here all right."</i></p>

<p><i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>"Nobody would have taken the body, would they?"</i></p>

<p><i>"What for?"</i></p>

<p><i>"A curiosity, perhaps."</i></p>

<p><i>"Don't be ridiculous. People just don't steal. Nobody steals."</i></p>

<p><i>"Well, then, there's only one solution."</i></p>

<p><i>"And?"</i></p>

<p><i>"He got up and walked away."</i></p>

<p><i>A pause. In the dark dream, Lantry expected to hear laughter. There
was none. Instead, the voice of the gravedigger, after a thoughtful
pause, said, "Yes. That's it, indeed. He got up and walked away."</i></p>

<p><i>"That's interesting to think about," said the other.</i></p>

<p><i>"Isn't it, though?"</i></p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lantry awoke. It had all been a dream, but God, how realistic. How
strangely the two men had carried on. But not unnaturally, oh, no. That
was exactly how you expected men of the future to talk. Men of the
future. Lantry grinned wryly. That was an anachronism for you. This
<i>was</i> the future. This was happening <i>now</i>. It wasn't 300 years from
now, it was now, not then, or any other time. This wasn't the Twentieth
Century. Oh, how calmly those two men in the dream had said, "He got up
and walked away." "&mdash;interesting to think about." "<i>Isn't</i> it, though?"
With never a quaver in their voices. With not so much as a glance over
their shoulders or a tremble of spade in hand. But, of course, with
their perfectly honest, logical minds, there was but one explanation;
certainly nobody had <i>stolen</i> the corpse. "<i>Nobody</i> steals." The corpse
had simply got up and walked off. The corpse was the only one who could
have <i>possibly</i> moved the corpse. By the few casual slow words of the
gravediggers Lantry knew what they were thinking. Here was a man that
had lain in suspended animation, not really dead, for hundreds of
years. The jarring about, the activity, had brought him back.</p>

<p>Everyone had heard of those little green toads that are sealed for
centuries inside mud rocks or in ice patties, alive, alive oh! And how
when scientists chipped them out and warmed them like marbles in their
hands the little toads leapt about and frisked and blinked. Then it
was only logical that the gravediggers think of William Lantry in like
fashion.</p>

<p>But what if the various parts were fitted together in the next day or
so? If the vanished body and the shattered, exploded incinerator were
connected? What if this fellow named Burke, who had returned pale from
Mars, went to the library again and said to the young woman he wanted
some books and she said, "Oh, your friend Lantry was in the other day."
And he'd say, "Lantry who? Don't know anyone by that name." And she'd
say, "Oh, he <i>lied</i>." And people in this time didn't lie. So it would
all form and coalesce, item by item, bit by bit. A pale man who was
pale and shouldn't be pale had lied and people don't lie, and a walking
man on a lonely country road had walked and people don't walk anymore,
and a body was missing from a cemetery, and the Incinerator had blown
up and and and&mdash;</p>

<p>They would come after him. They would find him. He would be easy to
find. He walked. He lied. He was pale. They would find him and take him
and stick him through the open fire lock of the nearest Burner and that
would be your Mr. William Lantry, like a fourth of July set-piece!</p>

<p>There was only one thing to be done efficiently and completely. He
arose in violent moves. His lips were wide and his dark eyes were
flared and there was a trembling and burning all through him. He must
kill and kill and kill and kill and kill. He must make his enemies into
friends, into people like himself who walked but shouldn't walk, who
were pale in a land of pinks. He must kill and then kill and then kill
again. He must make bodies and dead people and corpses. He must destroy
Incinerator after Flue after Burner after Incinerator. Explosion on
explosion. Death on death. Then, when the Incinerators were all in
thrown ruin, and the hastily established morgues were jammed with the
bodies of people shattered by the explosion, then he would begin his
making of friends, his enrollment of the dead in his own cause.</p>

<p>Before they traced and found and killed him, they must be killed
themselves. So far he was safe. He could kill and they would not kill
back. People simply do not go around killing. That was his safety
margin. He climbed out of the abandoned drain, stood in the road.</p>

<p>He took the knife from his pocket and hailed the next beetle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was like the Fourth of July! The biggest damned firecracker of them
all. The Science Port Incinerator split down the middle and flew apart.
It made a thousand small explosions that ended with a greater one. It
fell upon the town and crushed houses and burned trees. It woke people
from sleep and then put them to sleep again, forever, an instant later.</p>

<p>William Lantry, sitting in a beetle that was not his own, tuned idly to
a station on the audio dial. The collapse of the Incinerator had killed
some four hundred people. Many had been caught in flattened houses,
others struck by flying metal. A temporary morgue was being set up at&mdash;</p>

<p>An address was given.</p>

<p>Lantry noted it with a pad and pencil.</p>

<p>He could go on this way, he thought, from town to town, from country to
country, destroying the Burners, the Pillars of Fire, until the whole
clean magnificent framework of flame and cauterization was tumbled. He
made a fair estimate&mdash;each explosion averaged five hundred dead. You
could work that up to a hundred thousand in no time.</p>

<p>He pressed the floor stud of the beetle. Smiling, he drove off through
the dark streets of the city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The city coroner had requisitioned an old warehouse. From midnight
until four in the morning the grey beetles hissed down the rain-shiny
streets, turned in, and the bodies were laid out on the cold concrete
floors, with white sheets over them. It was a continuous flow until
about four-thirty, then it stopped. There were about two hundred bodies
there, white and cold.</p>

<p>The bodies were left alone; nobody stayed behind to tend them. There
was no use tending the dead; it was a useless procedure; the dead could
take care of themselves.</p>

<p>About five o'clock, with a touch of dawn in the east, the first trickle
of relatives arrived to identify their sons or their fathers or their
mothers or their uncles. The people moved quickly into the warehouse,
made the identification, moved quickly out again. By six o'clock, with
the sky still lighter in the east, this trickle had passed on, also.</p>

<p>William Lantry walked across the wide wet street and entered the
warehouse.</p>

<p>He held a piece of blue chalk in one hand.</p>

<p>He walked by the coroner who stood in the entranceway talking to two
others. "... drive the bodies to the Incinerator in Mellin Town,
tomorrow...." The voices faded.</p>

<p>Lantry moved, his feet echoing faintly on the cool concrete. A wave of
sourceless relief came to him as he walked among the shrouded figures.
He was among his own. And&mdash;better than that, by God! he had <i>created</i>
these! He had made them dead! He had procured for himself a vast number
of recumbent friends!</p>

<p>Was the coroner watching? Lantry turned his head. No. The warehouse
was calm and quiet and shadowed in the dark morning. The coroner was
walking away now, across the street, with his two attendants; a beetle
had drawn up on the other side of the street, and the coroner was going
over to talk with whoever was in the beetle.</p>

<p>William Lantry stood and made a blue chalk pentagram on the floor by
each of the bodies. He moved swiftly, swiftly, without a sound, without
blinking. In a few minutes, glancing up now and then to see if the
coroner was still busy, he had chalked the floor by a hundred bodies.
He straightened up and put the chalk in his pocket.</p>

<p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party, now
is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party, now is
the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party, now is the
time....</p>

<p>Lying in the earth, over the centuries, the processes and thoughts
of passing peoples and passing times had seeped down to him, slowly,
as into a deep-buried sponge. From some death-memory in him now,
ironically, repeatedly, a black typewriter clacked out black even lines
of pertinent words:</p>

<p>Now is the time for all good men, for all good men, to come to the aid
of&mdash;</p>

<p>William Lantry.</p>

<p><i>Other words</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Arise my love, and come away&mdash;</p>

<p>The quick brown fox jumped over.... <i>Paraphrase it.</i> The quick risen
body jumped over the tumbled Incinerator....</p>

<p>Lazarus, come forth from the tomb....</p>

<p>He knew the right words. He need only speak them as they had been
spoken over the centuries. He need only gesture with his hands and
speak the words, the dark words that would cause these bodies to
quiver, rise and walk!</p>

<p>And when they had risen he would take them through the town, they would
kill others and the others would rise and walk. By the end of the day
there would be thousands of good friends walking with him. And what of
the naive, living people of this year, this day, this hour? They would
be completely unprepared for it. They would go down to defeat because
they would not be expecting war of any sort. They wouldn't believe it
possible, it would all be over before they could convince themselves
that such an illogical thing could happen.</p>

<p>He lifted his hands. His lips moved. He said the words. He began in a
chanting whisper and then raised his voice, louder. He said the words
again and again. His eyes were closed tightly. His body swayed. He
spoke faster and faster. He began to move forward among the bodies.
The dark words flowed from his mouth. He was enchanted with his own
formulae. He stooped and made further blue symbols on the concrete, in
the fashion of long-dead sorcerers, smiling, confident. Any moment now
the first tremor of the still bodies, any moment now the rising, the
leaping up of the cold ones!</p>

<p>His hands lifted in the air. His head nodded. He spoke, he spoke, he
spoke. He gestured. He talked loudly over the bodies, his eyes flaring,
his body tensed. "Now!" he cried, violently. "Rise, <i>all</i> of you!"</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>"Rise!" he screamed, with a terrible torment in his voice.</p>

<p>The sheets lay in white blue-shadow folds over the silent bodies.</p>

<p>"Hear me, and act!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Far away, on the street, a beetle hissed along.</p>

<p>Again, again, again he shouted, pleaded. He got down by each body and
asked of it his particular violent favor. No reply. He strode wildly
between the even white rows, flinging his arms up, stooping again and
again to make blue symbols!</p>

<p>Lantry was very pale. He licked his lips. "Come on, get up," he said.
"They have, they always have, for a thousand years. When you make a
mark&mdash;so! and speak a word&mdash;so! they always rise! Why not you now, why
not you! Come on, come <i>on</i>, before <i>they</i> come back!"</p>

<p>The warehouse went up into shadow. There were steel beams across and
down. In it, under the roof, there was not a sound, except the raving
of a lonely man.</p>

<p>Lantry stopped.</p>

<p>Through the wide doors of the warehouse he caught a glimpse of the last
cold stars of morning.</p>

<p>This was the year 2349.</p>

<p>His eyes grew cold and his hands fell to his sides. He did not move.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once upon a time people shuddered when they heard the wind about the
house, once people raised crucifixes and wolfbane, and believed in
walking dead and bats and loping white wolves. And as long as they
believed, then so long did the dead, the bats, the loping wolves exist.
The mind gave birth and reality to them.</p>

<p>But....</p>

<p>He looked at the white sheeted bodies.</p>

<p><i>These</i> people did not believe.</p>

<p>They had never believed. They would never believe. They had never
imagined that the dead might walk. The dead went up flues in flame.
They had never heard superstition, never trembled or shuddered or
doubted in the dark. Walking dead people could not exist, they were
illogical. This was the year 2349, man, after all!</p>

<p>Therefore, these people could not rise, could not walk again. They were
dead and flat and cold. Nothing, chalk, imprecation, superstition,
could wind them up and set them walking. They were dead and <i>knew</i> they
were dead!</p>

<p>He was alone.</p>

<p>There were live people in the world who moved and drove beetles and
drank quiet drinks in little dimly illumined bars by country roads, and
kissed women and talked much good talk all day and every day.</p>

<p>But he was not alive.</p>

<p>Friction gave him what little warmth he possessed.</p>

<p>There were two hundred dead people here in this warehouse now,
cold upon the floor. The first dead people in a hundred years who
were allowed to be corpses for an extra hour or more. The first not
to be immediately trundled to the Incinerator and lit like so much
phosphorous.</p>

<p>He should be happy with them, among them.</p>

<p>He was not.</p>

<p>They were completely dead. They did not know nor believe in walking
once the heart had paused and stilled itself. They were deader than
dead ever was.</p>

<p>He was indeed alone, more alone than any man had ever been. He felt the
chill of his aloneness moving up into his chest, strangling him quietly.</p>

<p>William Lantry turned suddenly and gasped.</p>

<p>While he had stood there, someone had entered the warehouse. A tall man
with white hair, wearing a light-weight tan overcoat and no hat. How
long the man had been nearby there was no telling.</p>

<p>There was no reason to stay here. Lantry turned and started to walk
slowly out. He looked hastily at the man as he passed and the man
with the white hair looked back at him, curiously. Had he heard? The
imprecations, the pleadings, the shoutings? Did he suspect? Lantry
slowed his walk. Had this man seen him make the blue chalk marks? But
then, would he interpret them as symbols of an ancient superstition?
Probably not.</p>

<p>Reaching the door, Lantry paused. For a moment he did not want to do
anything but lie down and be coldly, really dead again and be carried
silently down the street to some distant burning flue and there
dispatched in ash and whispering fire. If he was indeed alone and there
was no chance to collect an army to his cause, what, then, existed as a
reason for going on? Killing? Yes, he'd kill a few thousand more. But
that wasn't enough. You can only do so much of that before they drag
you down.</p>

<p>He looked at the cold sky.</p>

<p>A rocket went across the black heaven, trailing fire.</p>

<p>Mars burned red among a million stars.</p>

<p>Mars. The library. The librarian. Talk. Returning rocket men. Tombs.</p>

<p>Lantry almost gave a shout. He restrained his hand, which wanted so
much to reach up into the sky and touch Mars. Lovely red star on the
sky. Good star that gave him sudden new hope. If he had a living heart
now it would be thrashing wildly, and sweat would be breaking out of
him and his pulses would be stammering, and tears would be in his eyes!</p>

<p>He would go down to where ever the rockets sprang up into space. He
would go to Mars, one way or another. He would go to the Martian tombs.
There, there, by God, were bodies, he would bet his last hatred on
it, that would rise and walk and work with him! Theirs was an ancient
culture, much different from that of Earth, patterned on the Egyptian,
if what the librarian had said was true. And the Egyptian&mdash;what a
crucible of dark superstition and midnight terror that culture had
been! Mars it <i>was</i>, then. Beautiful Mars!</p>

<p>But he must not attract attention to himself. He must move carefully.
He wanted to run, yes, to get away, but that would be the worst
possible move he could make. The man with the white hair was glancing
at Lantry from time to time, in the entranceway. There were too many
people about. If anything happened he would be outnumbered. So far he
had taken on only <i>one</i> man at a time.</p>

<p>Lantry forced himself to stop and stand on the steps before the
warehouse. The man with the white hair came on onto the steps also and
stood, looking at the sky. He looked as if he was going to speak at any
moment. He fumbled in his pockets, took out a packet of cigarettes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="ph1">V</p>

<p>They stood outside the morgue together, the tall pink, white-haired
man, and Lantry, hands in their pockets. It was a cool night with a
white shell of a moon that washed a house here, a road there, and
further on, parts of a river.</p>

<p>"Cigarette?" The man offered Lantry one.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>They lit up together. The man glanced at Lantry's mouth. "Cool night."</p>

<p>"Cool."</p>

<p>They shifted their feet. "Terrible accident."</p>

<p>"Terrible."</p>

<p>"So many dead."</p>

<p>"So many."</p>

<p>Lantry felt himself some sort of delicate weight upon a scale. The
other man did not seem to be looking at him, but rather listening
and feeling toward him. There was a feathery balance here that made
for vast discomfort. He wanted to move away and get out from under
this balancing, weighing. The tall white-haired man said, "My name's
McClure."</p>

<p>"Did you have any friends inside?" asked Lantry.</p>

<p>"No. A casual acquaintance. Awful accident."</p>

<p>"Awful."</p>

<p>They balanced each other. A beetle hissed by on the road with its
seventeen tires whirling quietly. The moon showed a little town further
over in the black hills.</p>

<p>"I say," said the man McClure.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you answer me a question?"</p>

<p>"Be glad to." He loosened the knife in his coat pocket, ready.</p>

<p>"Is your name Lantry?" asked the man at last.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"<i>William</i> Lantry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you're the man who came out of the Salem graveyard day before
yesterday, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, I'm glad to meet you, Lantry! We've been trying to find you
for the past twenty-four hours!"</p>

<p>The man seized his hand, pumped it, slapped him on the back.</p>

<p>"What, what?" said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, man, why did you run off? Do you realize what an instance
this is? We want to talk to you!"</p>

<p>McClure was smiling, glowing. Another handshake, another slap. "I
<i>thought</i> it was you!"</p>

<p>The man is mad, thought Lantry. Absolutely mad. Here I've toppled his
incinerators, killed people, and he's shaking my hand. Mad, mad!</p>

<p>"Will you come along to the Hall?" said the man, taking his elbow.</p>

<p>"Wh-what hall?" Lantry stepped back.</p>

<p>"The Science Hall, of course. It isn't every year we get a real case
of suspended animation. In small animals, yes, but in a man, hardly!
Will you come?"</p>

<p>"What's the act!" demanded Lantry, glaring. "What's all this talk."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, what do you mean?" the man was stunned.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Is that the only reason you want to see me?"</p>

<p>"What other reason would there be, Mr. Lantry? You don't know how glad
I am to see you!" He almost did a little dance. "I suspected. When we
were in there together. You being so pale and all. And then the way you
smoked your cigarette, something about it, and a lot of other things,
all subliminal. But it is you, isn't it, it <i>is</i> you!"</p>

<p>"It is I. William Lantry." Dryly.</p>

<p>"Good fellow! Come along!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beetle moved swiftly through the dawn streets. McClure talked
rapidly.</p>

<p>Lantry sat, listening, astounded. Here was this fool, McClure, playing
his cards for him! Here was this stupid scientist, or whatever,
accepting him not as a suspicious baggage, a murderous item. Oh
no! Quite the contrary! Only as a suspended animation case was he
considered! Not as a dangerous man at all. Far from it!</p>

<p>"Of course," cried McClure, grinning. "You didn't know where to go,
whom to turn to. It was all quite incredible to you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I had a feeling you'd be there at the morgue tonight," said McClure,
happily.</p>

<p>"Oh?" Lantry stiffened.</p>

<p>"Yes. Can't explain it. But you, how shall I put it? Ancient Americans?
You had funny ideas on death. And you were among the dead so long, I
felt you'd be drawn back by the accident, by the morgue and all. It's
not very logical. Silly, in fact. It's just a feeling. I hate feelings
but there it was. I came on a, I guess you'd call it a hunch, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"You might call it that."</p>

<p>"And there you were!"</p>

<p>"There I was," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"I've eaten."</p>

<p>"How did you get around?"</p>

<p>"I hitch-hiked."</p>

<p>"You <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"People gave me rides on the road."</p>

<p>"Remarkable."</p>

<p>"I imagine it sounds that way." He looked at the passing houses. "So
this is the era of space travel, is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've been traveling to Mars for some forty years now."</p>

<p>"Amazing. And those big funnels, those towers in the middle of every
town?"</p>

<p>"Those. Haven't you heard? The Incinerators. Oh, of course, they hadn't
anything of that sort in your time. Had some bad luck with them. An
explosion in Salem and one here, all in a forty-eight hour period. You
looked as if you were going to speak; what is it?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said Lantry. "How fortunate I got out of my coffin
when I did. I might well have been thrown into one of your Incinerators
and burned up."</p>

<p>"That would have been terrible, wouldn't it have?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>Lantry toyed with the dials on the beetle dash. He wouldn't go to Mars.
His plans were changed. If this fool simply refused to recognize an act
of violence when he stumbled upon it, then let him be a fool. If they
didn't connect the two explosions with a man from the tomb, all well
and good. Let them go on deluding themselves. If they couldn't imagine
someone being mean and nasty and murderous, heaven help them. He rubbed
his hands with satisfaction. No, no Martian trip for you, as yet,
Lantry lad. First we'll see what can be done boring from the inside.
Plenty of time. The Incinerators can wait an extra week or so. One has
to be subtle, you know. Any more immediate explosions might cause quite
a ripple of thought.</p>

<p>McClure was gabbling wildly on.</p>

<p>"Of course, you don't have to be examined immediately. You'll want a
rest. I'll put you up at my place."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I don't feel up to being probed and pulled. Plenty of time in
a week or so."</p>

<p>They drew up before a house and climbed out.</p>

<p>"You'll want to sleep, naturally."</p>

<p>"I've been asleep for centuries. Be glad to stay awake. I'm not a bit
tired."</p>

<p>"Good." McClure let them into the house. He headed for the drink bar.
"A drink will fix us up."</p>

<p>"You have one," said Lantry. "Later for me. I just want to sit down."</p>

<p>"By all means sit." McClure mixed himself a drink. He looked around the
room, looked at Lantry, paused for a moment with the drink in his hand,
tilted his head to one side, and put his tongue in his cheek. Then he
shrugged and stirred the drink. He walked slowly to a chair and sat,
sipping the drink quietly. He seemed to be listening for something.
"There are cigarettes on the table," he said.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Lantry took one and lit it and smoked it. He did not speak
for some time.</p>

<p>Lantry thought, I'm taking this all too easily. Maybe I should kill
and run. He's the only one that has found me, yet. Perhaps this is all
a trap. Perhaps we're simply sitting here waiting for the police. Or
whatever in hell they use for police these days. He looked at McClure.
No. They weren't waiting for police. They were waiting for something
else.</p>

<p>McClure didn't speak. He looked at Lantry's face and he looked at
Lantry's hands. He looked at Lantry's chest a long time, with easy
quietness. He sipped his drink. He looked at Lantry's feet.</p>

<p>Finally he said, "Where'd you get the clothing?"</p>

<p>"I asked someone for clothes and they gave these things to me. Darned
nice of them."</p>

<p>"You'll find that's how we are in this world. All you have to do is
ask."</p>

<p>McClure shut up again. His eyes moved. Only his eyes and nothing else.
Once or twice he lifted his drink.</p>

<p>A little clock ticked somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p>"Tell me about yourself, Mr. Lantry."</p>

<p>"Nothing much to tell."</p>

<p>"You're modest."</p>

<p>"Hardly. You know about the past. I know nothing of the future, or I
should say 'today' and day before yesterday. You don't learn much in a
coffin."</p>

<p>McClure did not speak. He suddenly sat forward in his chair and then
leaned back and shook his head.</p>

<p>They'll never suspect me, thought Lantry. They aren't superstitious,
they simply <i>can't</i> believe in a dead man walking. Therefore, I'll be
safe. I'll keep putting off the physical checkup. They're polite. They
won't force me. Then, I'll work it so I can get to Mars. After that,
the tombs, in my own good time, and the plan. God, how simple. How
naive these people are.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McClure sat across the room for five minutes. A coldness had come
over him. The color was very slowly going from his face, as one sees
the color of medicine vanishing as one presses the bulb at the top
of a dropper. He leaned forward, saying nothing, and offered another
cigarette to Lantry.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Lantry took it. McClure sat deeply back into his easy chair,
his knees folded one over the other. He did not look at Lantry, and
yet somehow did. The feeling of weighing and balancing returned.
McClure was like a tall thin master of hounds listening for something
that nobody else could hear. There are little silver whistles you can
blow that only dogs can hear. McClure seemed to be listening acutely,
sensitively for such an invisible whistle, listening with his eyes
and with his half-opened, dry mouth, and with his aching, breathing
nostrils.</p>

<p>Lantry sucked the cigarette, sucked the cigarette, sucked the
cigarette, and, as many times, blew out, blew out, blew out. McClure
was like some lean red-shagged hound listening and listening with a
slick slide of eyes to one side, with an apprehension in that hand that
was so precisely microscopic that one only sensed it, as one sensed
the invisible whistle, with some part of the brain deeper than eyes or
nostril or ear. McClure was all chemist's scale, all antennae.</p>

<p>The room was so quiet the cigarette smoke made some kind of invisible
noise rising to the ceiling. McClure was a thermometer, a chemist's
scales, a listening hound, a litmus paper, an antennae; all these.
Lantry did not move. Perhaps the feeling would pass. It had passed
before. McClure did not move for a long while and then, without a word,
he nodded at the sherry decanter, and Lantry refused as silently. They
sat looking but not looking at each other, again and away, again and
away.</p>

<p>McClure stiffened slowly. Lantry saw the color getting paler in those
lean cheeks, and the hand tightening on the sherry glass, and a
knowledge come at last to stay, never to go away, into the eyes.</p>

<p>Lantry did not move. He could not. All of this was of such a
fascination that he wanted only to see, to hear what would happen next.
It was McClure's show from here on in.</p>

<p>McClure said, "At first I thought it was the finest psychosis I have
ever seen. You, I mean. I thought, he's convinced himself, Lantry's
convinced himself, he's quite insane, he's told himself to do all these
little things." McClure talked as if in a dream, and continued talking
and didn't stop.</p>

<p>"I said to myself, he purposely doesn't breathe through his nose. I
watched your nostrils, Lantry. The little nostril hairs never once
quivered in the last hour. That wasn't enough. It was a fact I filed.
It wasn't enough. He breathes through his mouth, I said, on purpose.
And then I gave you a cigarette and you sucked and blew, sucked and
blew. None of it ever came out your nose. I told myself, well, that's
all right. He doesn't inhale. Is that terrible, is that suspect? All
in the mouth, all in the mouth. And then, I looked at your chest. I
watched. It never moved up or down, it did nothing. He's convinced
himself, I said to myself. He's convinced himself about all this.
He doesn't move his chest, except slowly, when he thinks you're not
looking. That's what I told myself."</p>

<p>The words went on in the silent room, not pausing, still in a dream.
"And then I offered you a drink but you don't drink and I thought, he
doesn't drink, I thought. Is <i>that</i> terrible? And I watched and watched
you all this time. Lantry holds his breath, he's fooling himself. But
now, yes, now, I understand it quite well. Now I know everything the
way it is. Do you know how I know? I do not hear breathing in the room.
I wait and I hear nothing. There is no beat of heart or intake of lung.
The room is so silent. Nonsense, one might say, but I know. At the
Incinerator I know. There is a difference. You enter a room where a
man is on a bed and you know immediately whether he will look up and
speak to you or whether he will not speak to you ever again. Laugh if
you will, but one can tell. It is a subliminal thing. It is the whistle
the dog hears when no human hears. It is the tick of a clock that has
ticked so long one no longer notices. Something is in a room when a man
lives in it. Something is not in the room when a man is dead in it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McClure shut his eyes a moment. He put down his sherry glass. He waited
a moment. He took up his cigarette and puffed it and then put it down
in a black tray.</p>

<p>"I am alone in this room," he said.</p>

<p>Lantry did not move.</p>

<p>"You are dead," said McClure. "My mind does not know this. It is not a
thinking thing. It is a thing of the senses and the subconscious. At
first I thought, this man <i>thinks</i> he is dead, risen from the dead,
a vampire. Is that not logical? Would not any man, buried as many
centuries, raised in a superstitious, ignorant culture, think likewise
of himself once risen from the tomb? Yes, that is logical. This man
has hypnotized himself and fitted his bodily functions so that they
would in no way interfere with his self-delusion, his great paranoia.
He governs his breathing. He tells himself, I cannot hear my breathing,
therefore I am dead. His inner mind censors the sound of breathing.
He does not allow himself to eat or drink. These things he probably
does in his sleep, with part of his mind, hiding the evidences of this
humanity from his deluded mind at other times."</p>

<p>McClure finished it. "I was wrong. You are not insane. You are not
deluding yourself. Nor me. This is all very illogical and&mdash;I must
admit&mdash;almost frightening. Does that make you feel good, to think you
frighten me? I have no label for you. You're a very odd man, Lantry.
I'm glad to have met you. This will make an interesting report indeed."</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong with me being dead?" said Lantry. "Is it a
crime?"</p>

<p>"You must admit it's highly unusual."</p>

<p>"But, still now, is it a crime?" asked Lantry.</p>

<p>"We have no crime, no criminal court. We want to examine you,
naturally, to find out how you have happened. It is like that chemical
which, one minute is inert, the next is living cell. Who can say where
what happened to what. You are that impossibility. It is enough to
drive a man quite insane."</p>

<p>"Will I be released when you are done fingering me?"</p>

<p>"You will not be held. If you don't wish to be examined, you will not
be. But I am hoping you will help by offering us your services."</p>

<p>"I might," said Lantry.</p>

<p>"But tell me," said McClure. "What were you doing at the morgue?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I heard you talking when I came in."</p>

<p>"I was merely curious."</p>

<p>"You're lying. That is very bad, Mr. Lantry. The truth is far better.
The truth is, is it not, that you are dead and, being the only one of
your sort, were lonely. Therefore you killed people to have company."</p>

<p>"How does that follow?"</p>

<p>McClure laughed. "Logic, my dear fellow. Once I <i>knew</i> you were really
dead, a moment ago, really a&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;a vampire (silly
word!) I tied you immediately to the Incinerator blasts. Before that
there was no reason to connect you. But once the one piece fell into
place, the fact that you were dead, then it was simple to guess your
loneliness, your hate, your envy, all of the tawdry motivations of a
walking corpse. It took only an instant then to see the Incinerators
blown to blazes, and then to think of you, among the bodies at the
morgue, seeking help, seeking friends and people like yourself to work
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're too damned smart!" Lantry was out of the chair. He was half way
to the other man when McClure rolled over and scuttled away, flinging
the sherry decanter. With a great despair Lantry realized that, like
a damned idiot, he had thrown away his one chance to kill McClure.
He should have done it earlier. It had been Lantry's one weapon, his
safety margin. If people in a society never <i>killed</i> each other, they
never <i>suspected</i> one another. You could walk up to any one of them and
kill him.</p>

<p>"Come back here!" Lantry threw the knife.</p>

<p>McClure got behind a chair. The idea of flight, of protection, of
fighting, was still new to him. He had part of the idea, but there was
still a bit of luck on Lantry's side if Lantry wanted to use it.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said McClure, holding the chair between himself and the
advancing man. "You want to kill me. It's odd, but true. I can't
understand it. You want to cut me with that knife or something like
that, and it's up to me to prevent you from doing such an odd thing."</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> kill you!" Lantry let it slip out. He cursed himself. That
was the worst possible thing to say.</p>

<p>Lantry lunged across the chair, clutching at McClure.</p>

<p>McClure was very logical. "It won't do you any good to kill me. You
<i>know</i> that." They wrestled and held each other in a wild, toppling
shuffle. Tables fell over, scattering articles. "You remember what
happened in the morgue?"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" screamed Lantry.</p>

<p>"You didn't raise <i>those</i> dead, did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" cried Lantry.</p>

<p>"Look here," said McClure, reasonably. "There will never be any more
like you, ever, there's no use."</p>

<p>"Then I'll destroy all of you, all of you!" screamed Lantry.</p>

<p>"And then what? You'll still be alone, with no more like you about."</p>

<p>"I'll go to Mars. They have tombs there. I'll find more like myself!"</p>

<p>"No," said McClure. "The executive order went through yesterday. All of
the tombs are being deprived of their bodies. They'll be burned in the
next week."</p>

<p>They fell together to the floor. Lantry got his hands on McClure's
throat.</p>

<p>"Please," said McClure. "Do you see, you'll <i>die</i>."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried Lantry.</p>

<p>"Once you kill all of us, and you're alone, you'll die! The hate will
die. That hate is what moves you, <i>nothing else</i>! That envy moves you.
Nothing else! You'll die, inevitably. You're not immortal. You're not
even alive, you're nothing but a moving hate."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" screamed Lantry, and began choking the man, beating his
head with his fists, crouched on the defenseless body. McClure looked
up at him with dying eyes.</p>

<p>The front door opened. Two men came in.</p>

<p>"I say," said one of them. "What's going on? A new game?"</p>

<p>Lantry jumped back and began to run.</p>

<p>"Yes, a new game!" said McClure, struggling up. "Catch him and you win!"</p>

<p>The two men caught Lantry. "We win," they said.</p>

<p>"Let me go!" Lantry thrashed, hitting them across their faces, bringing
blood.</p>

<p>"Hold him tight!" cried McClure.</p>

<p>They held him.</p>

<p>"A rough game, what?" one of them said. "What do we do <i>now</i>?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The beetle hissed along the shining road. Rain fell out of the sky and
a wind ripped at the dark green wet trees. In the beetle, his hands
on the half-wheel, McClure was talking. His voice was a susurrant, a
whispering, a hypnotic thing. The two other men sat in the back seat.
Lantry sat, or rather lay, in the front seat, his head back, his eyes
faintly open, the glowing green light of the dash dials showing on his
cheeks. His mouth was relaxed. He did not speak.</p>

<p>McClure talked quietly and logically, about life and moving, about
death and not moving, about the sun and the great sun Incinerator,
about the emptied tombyard, about hatred and how hate lived and made
a clay man live and move, and how illogical it all was, it all was,
it all was. One was dead, was dead, was dead, that was all, all, all.
One did not try to be otherwise. The car whispered on the moving road.
The rain spatted gently on the windshield. The men in the back seat
conversed quietly. Where were they going, going? To the Incinerator, of
course. Cigarette smoke moved slowly up on the air, curling and tying
into itself in grey loops and spirals. One was dead and must accept it.</p>

<p>Lantry did not move. He was a marionette, the strings cut. There was
only a tiny hatred in his heart, in his eyes, like twin coals, feeble,
glowing, fading.</p>

<p>I am Poe, he thought. I am all that is left of Edgar Allan Poe, and
I am all that is left of Ambrose Bierce and all that is left of a
man named Lovecraft. I am a grey night bat with sharp teeth, and I
am a square black monolith monster. I am Osiris and Baal and Set. I
am the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead. I am the house of Usher,
falling into flame. I am the Red Death. I am the man mortared into
the catacomb with a cask of Amontillado.... I am a dancing skeleton.
I am a coffin, a shroud, a lightning bolt reflected in an old house
window. I am an autumn-empty tree, I am a rapping, flinging shutter. I
am a yellowed volume turned by a claw hand. I am an organ played in an
attic at midnight. I am a mask, a skull mask behind an oak tree on the
last day of October. I am a poison apple bobbling in a water tub for
child noses to bump at, for child teeth to snap.... I am a black candle
lighted before an inverted cross. I am a coffin lid, a sheet with eyes,
a footstep on a black stairwell. I am Dunsany and Machen and I am the
Legend of Sleepy Hollow. I am The Monkey's Paw and I am The Phantom
Rickshaw. I am the Cat and the Canary, The Gorilla, the Bat. I am the
ghost of Hamlet's father on the castle wall.</p>

<p>All of these things am I. And now these last things will be burned.
While I lived <i>they</i> still lived. While I moved and hated and existed,
<i>they</i> still existed. I am <i>all</i> that remembers them. I am all of them
that <i>still</i> goes on, and will <i>not</i> go on after tonight. Tonight, all
of us, Poe and Bierce and Hamlet's father, we burn together. They will
make a big heap of us and burn us like a bonfire, like things of Guy
Fawkes' day, gasoline, torch-light, cries and all!</p>

<p>And what a wailing will we put up. The world will be clean of us, but
in our going we shall say, oh what is the world like, clean of fear,
where is the dark imagination from the dark time, the thrill and the
anticipation, the suspense of old October, gone, never more to come
again, flattened and smashed and burned by the rocket people, by the
Incinerator people, destroyed and obliterated, to be replaced by doors
that open and close and lights that go on or off without fear. If
only you could remember how once <i>we</i> lived, what Hallowe'en was to
us, and what Poe was, and how we gloried in the dark morbidities. One
more drink, dear friends, of Amontillado, before the burning. All of
this, all, exists but in one last brain on earth. A whole world dying
tonight. One more drink, pray.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said McClure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Incinerator was brightly lighted. There was quiet music nearby.
McClure got out of the beetle, came around to the other side. He opened
the door. Lantry simply lay there. The talking and the logical talking
had slowly drained him of life. He was no more than wax now, with a
small glow in his eyes. This future world, how the men <i>talked</i> to you,
how logically they reasoned away your life. They wouldn't believe in
him. The force of their disbelief froze him. He could not move his arms
or his legs. He could only mumble senselessly, coldly, eyes flickering.</p>

<p>McClure and the two others helped him out of the car, put him in a
golden box and rolled him on a roller table into the warm glowing
interior of the building.</p>

<p>I am Edgar Allan Poe, I am Ambrose Bierce, I am Hallowe'en, I am a
coffin, a shroud, a Monkey's Paw, a Phantom, a Vampire....</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said McClure, quietly, over him. "I know. I know."</p>

<p>The table glided. The walls swung over him and by him, the music
played. You are dead, you are logically dead.</p>

<p>I am Usher, I am the Maelstrom, I am the MS Found In A Bottle, I am
the Pit and I am the Pendulum, I am the Telltale Heart, I am the Raven
nevermore, nevermore.</p>

<p>"Yes," said McClure, as they walked softly. "I know."</p>

<p>"I am in the catacomb," cried Lantry.</p>

<p>"Yes, the catacomb," said the walking man over him.</p>

<p>"I am being chained to a wall, and there is no bottle of Amontillado
here!" cried Lantry weakly, eyes closed.</p>

<p>"Yes," someone said.</p>

<p>There was movement. The flame door opened.</p>

<p>"Now someone is mortaring up the cell, closing me in!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>know</i>." A whisper.</p>

<p>The golden box slid into the flame lock.</p>

<p>"I'm being walled in! A very good joke indeed! Let us be gone!" A wild
scream and much laughter.</p>

<p>"We know, we understand...."</p>

<p>The inner flame lock opened. The golden coffin shot forth into flame.</p>

<p><i>"For the love of God, Montresor! For the love of God!"</i></p>
